      "Surgery\n",

      "Surgery can be used for many purposes.\n",
      "• Treatment. Treatment of cancer by surgery involves\n",
      "removal of the tumor to cure the disease. This is typical-\n",
      "ly done when the cancer is localized to a discrete area.\n",
      "Along with the cancer, some part of the normal sur-\n",
      "rounding tissue is also removed to ensure that no cancer\n",
      "cells remain in the area. Since cancer usually spreads\n",
      "via the lymphatic system, adjoining lymph nodes may\n",
      "be examined and sometimes they are removed as well.\n",
      "• Preventive surgery. Preventive or prophylactic surgery\n",
      "involves removal of an abnormal looking area that is\n",
      "likely to become malignant over time. For example,\n",
      "40% of the people with a colon disease known as ulcer-\n",
      "ative colitis, ultimately die of colon cancer. Rather than\n",
      "live with the fear of developing colon cancer, these peo-\n",
      "ple may choose to have their colons removed and\n",
      "reduce the risk significantly.\n",
      "• Diagnostic purposes. The most definitive tool for diag-\n",
      "nosing cancer is a biopsy. Sometimes, a biopsy can be\n",
      "performed by inserting a needle through the skin. How-\n",
      "ever, at other times, the only way to obtain some tissue\n",
      "sample for biopsy is by performing a surgical operation.\n",
      "• Cytoreductive surgery is a procedure where the doctor\n",
      "removes as much of the cancer as possible, and then\n",
      "treats the remaining with radiation therapy or chemo-\n",
      "therapy or both.\n",
      "• Palliative surgery is aimed at curing the symptoms, not\n",
      "the cancer. Usually, in such cases, the tumor is so large or\n",
      "has spread so much that removing the entire tumor is not\n",
      "an option. For example, a tumor in the abdomen may be\n",
      "so large that it may press on and block a portion of the\n",
      "intestine, interfering with digestion and causing pain and\n",
      "vomiting. “Debulking surgery” may remove a part of the\n",
      "blockage and relieve the symptoms. In tumors that are\n",

      "secrete the hormones is an option. For example, in\n",
      "prostate cancer, the release of testosterone by the testi-\n",
      "cles stimulates the growth of cancerous cells. Hence, a\n",
      "man may undergo an “orchiectomy” (removal of testi-\n",
      "cles) to slow the progress of the disease. Similarly, in a\n",

      "Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy and,\n",

      "according to their structure based on the number of basic\n",
      "sugar, or saccharide units they contain.\n",
      "A monosaccharide is the simplest carbohydrate and\n",

      "product of the digestion of starch), sucrose (table sugar),\n",
      "and lactose (the sugar in milk). These disaccharides must\n",

      "hemoglobin (Hb) that is found in red blood cells. This\n",

      "of the body. When the oxygen/hemoglobin complex\n",
      "reaches a muscle where it is needed, the oxygen is\n",
      "released. Because the oxygen binding process is\n",
      "reversible, hemoglobin can be used over and over again\n",

      "Definition\n",
      "A cataract is a cloudiness or opacity in the normally\n",
      "transparent crystalline lens of the eye. This cloudiness\n",
      "can cause a decrease in vision and may lead to eventual\n",
      "blindness.\n",
      "Description\n",
      "The human eye has several parts. The outer layer of\n",
      "the eyeball consists of a transparent dome-shaped cornea\n",
      "and an opaque, white sclera. The cornea and sclera help\n",
      "protect the eye. The next layer includes the iris, pupil, and\n",
      "ciliary body. The iris is the colored part of the eye and the\n",
      "pupil is the small dark round hole in the middle of the iris.\n",
      "The pupil and iris allow light into the eye. The ciliary body\n",
      "contains muscles that help in the eye’s focusing ability.\n",
      "The lens lies behind the pupil and iris. It is covered by a\n",
      "cellophane-like capsule. The lens is normally transparent,\n",
      "elliptical in shape, and somewhat elastic. This elasticity\n",
      "allows the lens to focus on both near and far objects. The\n",
      "lens is attached to the ciliary body by fibers (zonules of\n",
      "Zinn). Muscles in the ciliary body act on the zonules,\n",
      "which then change the shape of the lens. This process is\n",
      "called accommodation—the lens focuses images to help\n",
      "make vision clear. As people age, the lens hardens and\n",
      "changes shape less easily. As a result, the accommodation\n",
      "process becomes more difficult, making it harder to see\n",
      "things up close. This generally occurs around the age of 40\n",
      "and continues until about age 65. The condition is called\n",
      "presbyopia. It is a normal condition of aging, generally\n",
      "resulting in the need for reading glasses.\n",
      "The lens is made up of approximately 35% protein\n",
      "and 65% water. As people age, degenerative changes in\n",
      "the lens’ proteins occur. Changes in the proteins, water\n",
      "content, enzymes, and other chemicals are some of the\n",
      "reasons for the formation of a cataract.\n",
      "The major areas of the lens are the nucleus, the cor-\n",
      "tex, and the capsule. The nucleus is in the center of the\n",
      "lens, the cortex surrounds the nucleus, and the capsule is\n",
      "the outer layer. Opacities can occur in any area of the\n",
      "lens. Cataracts, then, can be classified according to loca-\n",
      "tion (nuclear, cortical, or posterior subcapular cataracts).\n",
      "The density and location of the cataract determines the\n",
      "amount of vision affected. If the cataract forms in the area\n",
      "of the lens directly behind the pupil, vision may be signif-\n",
      "icantly impaired. A cataract that occurs on the outer edges\n",
      "or side of the lens will create less of a visual problem.\n",
      "Cataracts in the elderly are so common that they are\n",
      "thought to be a normal part of the aging process.\n",
      "Between the ages of 52 and 64, there is a 50% chance of\n",
      "having a cataract, while at least 70% of those 70 and\n",
      "older are affected. Cataracts associated with aging (senile\n",
      "or age-related cataracts) most often occur in both eyes,\n",
      "with each cataract progressing at a different rate. Initial-\n",
      "ly, cataracts may not affect vision. If the cataract remains\n",
      "small or at the periphery of the lens, the visual changes\n",
      "may be minor.\n",
      "Cataracts that occur in people other than the elderly\n",
      "are much less common. Congenital cataracts occur very\n",
      "rarely in newborns. Genetic defects or an infection or\n",

      "causes of congenital cataracts. Traumatic cataracts may\n",
      "develop after a foreign body or trauma injures the lens or\n",

      "Description\n",
      "Celiac disease occurs when the body reacts abnor-\n",
      "mally to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, barley, and\n",
      "possibly oats. When someone with celiac disease eats\n",
      "foods containing gluten, that person’s immune system\n",
      "causes an inflammatory response in the small intestine,\n",
      "which damages the tissues and results in impaired ability\n",
      "to absorb nutrients from foods. The inflammation and\n",
      "malabsorption create wide-ranging problems in many\n",
      "systems of the body. Since the body’s own immune sys-\n",
      "tem causes the damage, celiac disease is classified as an\n",

      "the disease is uncertain. Estimates vary from one in\n",
      "5000, to as many as one in every 300 individuals with\n",

      "to be different from one European country to another,\n",
      "and between Europe and the United States. This may be\n",
      "due to differences in diet and/or unrecognized disease. A\n",

      "Definition\n",
      "Cerebral palsy (CP) is the term used for a group of\n",
      "nonprogressive disorders of movement and posture\n",
      "caused by abnormal development of, or damage to,\n",
      "motor control centers of the brain. CP is caused by events\n",
      "before, during, or after birth. The abnormalities of mus-\n",
      "cle control that define CP are often accompanied by\n",
      "other neurological and physical abnormalities.\n",
      "Description\n",
      "V oluntary movement (walking, grasping, chewing,\n",
      "etc.) is primarily accomplished using muscles that are\n",
      "attached to bones, known as the skeletal muscles. Control\n",
      "of the skeletal muscles originates in the cerebral cortex,\n",
      "the largest portion of the brain. Palsy means paralysis ,\n",
      "but may also be used to describe uncontrolled muscle\n",
      "movement. Therefore, cerebral palsy encompasses any\n",
      "disorder of abnormal movement and paralysis caused by\n",

      "selves and/or in the peripheral nervous system (nerves\n",

      "CP is not a specific diagnosis, but is more accurately\n",
      "considered a description—a description of a broad but\n",
      "defined group of neurological and physical problems.\n",
      "The symptoms of CP and their severity are quite\n",
      "variable. Those with CP may have only minor difficulty\n",
      "with fine motor skills, such as grasping and manipulating\n",
      "items with their hands. A severe form of CP could\n",
      "involve significant muscle problems in all four limbs,\n",
      "mental retardation, seizures, and difficulties with\n",
      "vision, speech, and hearing.\n",
      "Muscles that receive defective messages from the\n",

      "There can also be a lack of balance and coordination with\n",

      "was accepted that most cases of CP were due to brain\n",
      "injuries received during a traumatic birth, known as birth\n",
      "asphyxia. However, extensive research in the 1980s\n",
      "showed that only 5–10% of CP can be attributed to birth\n",

      "Description\n",
      "The procedure to remove cerebrospinal fluid is\n",
      "called a lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, because the area\n",
      "of the spinal column used to obtain the sample is in the\n",
      "lumbar spine, or lower section of the back. In rare\n",
      "instances, such as a spinal fluid blockage in the middle of\n",
      "the back, a doctor may perform a spinal tap in the neck.\n",
      "The lower lumbar spine (usually between the vertebrae\n",
      "known as L4–5) is preferable because the spinal cord\n",
      "stops near L2, and a needle introduced below this level\n",
      "will miss the spinal cord and encounter only nerve roots,\n",
      "which are easily pushed aside.\n",
      "A lumbar puncture takes about 30 minutes. Patients\n",
      "can undergo the test in a doctor’s office, laboratory, or\n",
      "outpatient hospital setting. Sometimes it requires an\n",
      "inpatient hospital stay. If the patient has spinal arthritis,\n",
      "is extremely uncooperative, or obese, it may be necessary\n",
      "to introduce the spinal needle using x-ray guidance.\n",
      "In order to get an accurate sample of cerebrospinal\n",
      "fluid, it is critical that a patient is in the proper position.\n",

      "If irrigation cannot be used or fails to remove the\n",

      "Description\n",
      "The spine is made up of 33 bones called vertebrae\n",
      "separated by spongy rings of elastic material. These\n",
      "rings, known as disks, are often compared to shock\n",
      "absorbers because they help to cushion the vertebrae.\n",
      "Just as importantly, they also make it possible to turn the\n",

      "outer edge of a disk may tear, allowing the gelatinous\n",
      "material inside to bulge outward (herniated disk ). This\n",
      "can put pressure on nerves that exit the spine. Two adja-\n",
      "cent vertebrae may rub together (sometimes resulting in\n",
      "bone spurs) that can also pinch these nerves. In other\n",
      "cases, the inner part of the ring may push on the spinal\n",
      "cord itself, which passes through the disk. Any of these\n",
      "situations can cause pain and limit movement. While\n",

      "Description\n",
      "CMT is named for the three neurologists who first\n",
      "described the condition in the late 1800s. It is also known\n",
      "as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, and is some-\n",
      "times called peroneal muscular atrophy, referring to the\n",
      "muscles in the leg that are often affected. The age of onset\n",
      "of CMT can vary anywhere from young childhood to the\n",
      "50s or 60s. Symptoms typically begin by the age of 20. For\n",
      "reasons yet unknown, the severity in symptoms can also\n",
      "vary greatly, even among members of the same family.\n",
      "Although CMT has been described for many years,\n",
      "it is only since the early 1990s that the genetic cause of\n",
      "many of the types of CMT have become known. There-\n",
      "fore, knowledge about CMT has increased dramatically\n",
      "within a short time.\n",
      "The peripheral nerves\n",
      "CMT affects the peripheral nerves, those groups of\n",
      "nerve cells carrying information to and from the spinal\n",
      "cord. CMT decreases the ability of these nerves to carry\n",
      "motor commands to muscles, especially those furthest\n",
      "from the spinal cord located in the feet and hands. As a\n",
      "result, the muscles connected to these nerves eventually\n",
      "weaken. CMT also affects the sensory nerves that carry\n",
      "information from the limbs to the brain. Therefore peo-\n",
      "ple with CMT also have sensory loss. This causes symp-\n",
      "toms such as not being able to tell if something is hot or\n",
      "cold or difficulties with balance.\n",
      "There are two parts of the nerve that can be affected\n",
      "in CMT. A nerve can be likened to an electrical wire, in\n",
      "which the wire part is the axon of the nerve and the insu-\n",
      "lation surrounding it is the myelin sheath. The job of the\n",
      "myelin is to help messages travel very fast through the\n",
      "nerves. CMT is usually classified depending on which\n",
      "part of the nerve is affected. People who have problems\n",
      "with the myelin have CMT type 1 and people who have\n",
      "abnormalities of the axon have CMT type 2.\n",
      "Specialized testing of the nerves, called nerve con-\n",
      "duction testing (NCV), can be performed to determine if\n",
      "a person has CMT1 or CMT2. These tests measure the\n",
      "speed at which messages travel through the nerves. In\n",
      "CMT1, the messages move too slowly, but in CMT2 the\n",
      "messages travel at the normal speed.\n",
      "Demographics\n",
      "CMT has been diagnosed in people from all over the\n",
      "world. It occurs in approximately one in 2,500 people,\n",
      "which is about the same incidence as multiple sclerosis. It\n",
      "is the most common type of inherited neurologic condition.\n",
      "Signs and symptoms\n",
      "CMT is caused by changes (mutations) in any one of\n",
      "a number of genes that carry the instructions to make the\n",
      "peripheral nerves. Genes contain the instructions for how\n",
      "the body grows and develops before and after a person is\n",
      "born. There are probably at least 15 different genes that\n",
      "can cause CMT. However, as of early 2001, many have\n",
      "not yet been identified.\n",
      "CMT types 1 and 2 can be broken down into sub-\n",
      "types based upon the gene that is causing CMT. The sub-\n",
      "types are labeled by letters, so there is CMT1A, CMT1B,\n",
      "etc. Therefore, the gene with a mutation that causes\n",

      "gene. If they have a mutation in one copy of their Cx32\n",

      "affected, and a daughter may only have mild symptoms.\n",
      "When males pass on an X chromosome, they have a\n",
      "daughter. When they pass on a Y chromosome, they have\n",
      "a son. Since the Cx32 mutation is on the X chromosome,\n",
      "a man with CMTX will always pass the Cx32 mutation\n",
      "on to his daughters. However, when he has a son, he\n",
      "passes on the Y chromosome, and therefore the son will\n",
      "not be affected. Therefore, an affected male passes the\n",

      "none of his sons.\n",
      "CMT4 has autosomal recessive inheritance. Males\n",

      "and eliminate secretions from the respiratory system.\n",
      "Purpose\n",
      "The purpose of chest physical therapy, also called\n",
      "chest physiotherapy, is to help patients breathe more\n",
      "freely and to get more oxygen into the body. Chest physi-\n",
      "cal therapy includes postural drainage, chest percussion,\n",
      "chest vibration, turning, deep breathing exercises, and\n",
      "coughing. It is usually done in conjunction with other\n",
      "treatments to rid the airways of secretions. These other\n",
      "treatments include suctioning, nebulizer treatments, and\n",
      "the administration of expectorant drugs.\n",
      "Chest physical therapy can be used with newborns,\n",
      "infants, children, and adults. People who benefit from\n",
      "chest physical therapy exhibit a wide range of problems\n",
      "that make it difficult to clear secretions from their lungs.\n",

      "Depending on the circumstances, chest physical therapy\n",
      "may be performed by anyone from a respiratory care ther-\n",
      "apist to a trained member of the patient’s family. Different\n",
      "patient conditions warrant different levels of training.\n",
      "Chest physical therapy consists of a variety of proce-\n",
      "dures that are applied depending on the patient’s health\n",
      "and condition. Hospitalized patients are reevaluated fre-\n",
      "quently to establish which procedures are most effective\n",

      "patients and those dependent on mechanical respiration\n",
      "are turned once every one to two hours around the clock.\n",
      "Coughing\n",
      "Coughing helps break up secretions in the lungs so\n",
      "that the mucus can be suctioned out or expectorated.\n",

      "Before the varicella vaccine (Varivax) was released\n",
      "for use in 1995, virtually all of the four million children\n",

      "Within a few hours or days small red spots begin to appear\n",
      "on the scalp, neck, or upper half of the trunk. After a further\n",
      "12–24 hours the spots typically become itchy, fluid-filled\n",
      "bumps called vesicles, which continue to appear in crops\n",
      "for the next two to five days. In any area of skin, lesions of\n",
      "a variety of stages can be seen. These blisters can spread to\n",
      "cover much of the skin, and in some cases may also be\n",
      "found inside the mouth, nose, ears, vagina, or rectum.\n",
      "Some people develop only a few blisters, but in most cases\n",
      "the number reaches 250–500. The blisters soon begin to\n",
      "form scabs and fall off. Scarring usually does not occur\n",
      "unless the blisters have been scratched and become infect-\n",
      "ed. Occasionally a minor and temporary darkening of the\n",
      "skin (called hyperpigmentation) is noticed around some\n",
      "of the blisters. The degree of itchiness can range from bare-\n",
      "ly noticeable to extreme. Some chickenpox sufferers also\n",
      "have headaches, abdominal pain, or a fever. Full recovery\n",
      "usually takes five to 10 days after the first symptoms\n",
      "appear. Again, the most severe cases of the disease tend to\n",

      "into the opening, it bursts under the pressure, releasing\n",

      "renowned story concerns Harvey Lillard, a janitor in the\n",
      "office where Palmer worked. The man had been deaf for\n",
      "17 years, ever since he had sustained an injury to his\n",
      "upper spine. Palmer performed an adjustment on a painful\n",
      "vertebra in the region of the injury and Lillard’s hearing\n",
      "was reputedly restored. Palmer theorized that all commu-\n",
      "nication from the brain to the rest of the body passes\n",
      "through the spinal canal, and areas that are poorly aligned\n",
      "or under stress can cause physical symptoms both in the\n",
      "spine and in other areas of the body. Thus the body has\n",
      "the innate intelligence to heal itself when unencumbered\n",
      "by spinal irregularities causing nerve interference. After\n",
      "his success with Lillard, other patients began coming to\n",
      "him for care, and responded well to adjustments. This\n",
      "resulted in Palmer’s further study of the relationship\n",

      "Description\n",
      "Choking is a medical emergency. When a person is\n",
      "choking, air cannot reach the lungs. If the airways cannot\n",
      "be cleared,death follows rapidly.\n",
      "Anyone can choke, but choking is more common in\n",

      "accidental death in young children who are apt to put toys\n",
      "or coins in their mouths, then unintentionally inhale them.\n",
      "About 3,000 adults die each year from choking on food.\n",
      "People also choke because infection causes the\n",
      "throat tissue to swell shut. It is believed that this is what\n",
      "caused George Washington’s death. Allergic reactions\n",
      "can also cause the throat to swell shut. Acute allergic\n",
      "reactions are called anaphylactic reactions and may be\n",
      "fatal. Strangulation puts external pressure on the trachea\n",
      "causing another form of choking.\n",
      "Finally, people can choke from obstructive sleep\n",

      "intestine and take part in digestion.\n",
      "Bile that has just been produced by the liver is sterile\n",
      "(free of bacteria). This is partly due to its antibacterial\n",
      "properties; these are produced by the immunoglobulins\n",
      "(antibodies) secreted in bile, the bile acids which inhibit\n",
      "bacterial growth themselves, and mucus.\n",
      "A small number of bacteria may be present in the bile\n",
      "ducts and gallbladder, getting there by moving backward\n",
      "from the intestine, which unlike the bile ducts, contains\n",
      "large numbers of bacteria. The normal flow of bile out of\n",
      "the ducts and into the intestine also helps keep too many\n",
      "organisms from multiplying. Bacteria also reach the bile\n",
      "ducts from the lymph tissue or from the blood stream.\n",
      "When the passage of bile out of the ducts is blocked,\n",
      "the few bacteria that are there rapidly reproduce. A par-\n",
      "tial blockage to the flow of bile can occur when a stone\n",
      "from the gallbladder blocks the duct, and also allows\n",
      "bacteria to flow back into the CBD, and creates ideal\n",
      "conditions for their growth. Tumors, on the other hand,\n",
      "cause a more complete blockage of bile flow, both in and\n",
      "out, so fewer infections occur. The reproducing organ-\n",

      "multiple organs such as the liver and heart valves.\n",
      "Another source of inflammation of the bile ducts\n",
      "occurs in diseases of altered immunity, known as “autoim-\n",

      "ple of an autoimmune disease involving the bile ducts.\n",
      "Causes and symptoms\n",
      "As noted above, the two things that are needed for\n",
      "cholangitis to occur are: 1) obstruction to bile flow, and\n",
      "2) presence of bacteria within the bile ducts. The most\n",
      "common cause of cholangitis is infection of the bile\n",
      "ducts due to blockage by a gallstone. Strictures (portions\n",
      "of ducts that have become narrow) also function in the\n",
      "same way. Strictures may be due to congenital (birth)\n",
      "abnormalities of the bile ducts, form as a result of injury\n",
      "to the bile duct (such as surgery, trauma), or result from\n",
      "inflammation that leads to scar tissue and narrowing.\n",
      "The bacterium most commonly associated with infec-\n",
      "tion of the bile ducts is Escherichia coli (E. coli)which is a\n",
      "normal inhabitant of the intestine. In some cases, more\n",
      "than one type of bacteria is involved. Patients with AIDS\n",
      "can develop infection of narrowed bile ducts with unusual\n",
      "organisms such as Cryptosporidiumand others.\n",
      "The three symptoms present in about 70% of patients\n",
      "with cholangitis are abdominal pain, fever, and jaundice.\n",
      "Some patients only have chills and fever with minimal\n",
      "abdominal symptoms. Jaundice or yellow discoloration of\n",
      "the skin and eyes occurs in about 80% of patients. The\n",
      "color change is due to bile pigments that accumulate in the\n",

      "Inflammation due to the autoimmune disease prima-\n",

      "duct and also cause cholangitis, but as noted, infection is\n",
      "relatively infrequent; in fact cholangitis occurs in only\n",
      "about one in six patients with tumors.\n",
      "Another type of bile duct infection occurs mainly in\n",
      "Southeast Asia and is known as recurrent pyogenic\n",
      "cholangitis or Oriental cholangitis. It has also been iden-\n",
      "tified in Asians immigrating to North America. Most\n",
      "patients have stones in the bile ducts and/or gallbladder,\n",
      "and many cases are associated with the presence of para-\n",
      "sites within the ducts. The role of parasites in causing\n",
      "infection is not clear. Many researchers believe that they\n",
      "are just coincidental, and have nothing to do with the\n",
      "stones or infection.\n",
      "Diagnosis\n",
      "The above symptoms alone are very suggestive of\n",
      "cholangitis; however, it is important to determine the exact\n",
      "cause and site of possible obstruction. This is because\n",
      "attacks are likely to recur, and different causes require dif-\n",
      "ferent treatments. For example, the treatment of cholangi-\n",
      "tis due to a stone in the CBD is different from that due to\n",
      "bile duct strictures. An elevated white blood count sug-\n",
      "gests infection, but may be normal in 20% of patients.\n",
      "Abnormal or elevated tests of liver function, such as biliru-\n",

      "Purpose\n",
      "Cholesterol is a chemical that can both benefit and\n",
      "harm the body. On the good side, cholesterol plays impor-\n",
      "tant roles in the structure of cells and in the production of\n",
      "hormones. But too much cholesterol in the blood can lead\n",
      "to heart and blood vessel disease. To complicate matters,\n",
      "not all cholesterol contributes to heart and blood vessel\n",
      "problems. One type, called high-density lipoprotein\n",
      "(HDL) cholesterol, or “good cholesterol,” actually lowers\n",
      "the risk of these problems. The other type, low-density\n",
      "lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or “bad cholesterol,” is the\n",
      "type that threatens people’s health. The names reflect the\n",
      "way cholesterol moves through the body. To travel\n",
      "through the bloodstream, cholesterol must attach itself to\n",
      "a protein. The combination of a protein and a fatty sub-\n",
      "stance like cholesterol is called a lipoprotein.\n",
      "Many factors may contribute to the fact that some\n",
      "people have higher cholesterol levels than others. A diet\n",
      "high in certain types of fats is one factor. Medical prob-\n",
      "lems such as poorly controlled diabetes, an underactive\n",
      "thyroid gland, an overactive pituitary gland, liver disease\n",
      "or kidney failure also may cause high cholesterol levels.\n",
      "And some people have inherited disorders that prevent\n",
      "their bodies from properly using and eliminating fats.\n",
      "This allows cholesterol to build up in the blood.\n",
      "Treatment for high cholesterol levels usually begins\n",
      "with changes in daily habits. By losing weight, stopping\n",
      "smoking, exercising more and reducing the amount of\n",

      "reduce their risk of health problems.\n",
      "Description\n",
      "There are four different classes of cholesterol lower-\n",

      "Bile acid sequesterants are drugs that act by binding\n",
      "with the bile produced by the liver. Bile helps the diges-\n",
      "tion and absorption of fats in the intestine. By blocking\n",
      "the digestion of fats, bile acid sequesterants prevent the\n",
      "formation of cholesterol. Drugs in this class include:\n",
      "cholestyramine (Questran); colestipol (Colestid); and\n",
      "colesevalam (Welchol).\n",
      "HMG-CoA inhibitors, often called “statins,” are\n",
      "drugs that block an enzyme called “3-hydroxy-3-methyl-\n",
      "glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase.” This blocks one of the\n",
      "steps in converting fat to cholesterol. These are the most\n",
      "effective cholesterol lowering agents available. Drugs in\n",
      "this group include: atorvastatin (Lipitor); cerivastatin\n",
      "(Baycol); fluvastatin (Lescol); lovastatin (Mevacor);\n",
      "pravastatin (Pravachol); and simvastatin (Zocor).\n",
      "Fibric acid derivatives include clofibrate (Atromid-\n",
      "S); gemfibrozil (Lopid); and fenofibrate (Tricor).\n",
      "Although these drugs are less effective than the statins at\n",
      "lowering total cholesterol, they may be able to lower the\n",
      "low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol while raising\n",
      "the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Their\n",
      "exact mechanism of action is believed to be associated\n",
      "with inhibition of lipoprotein lipase activity.\n",
      "Niacin, vitamin B-3, is also effective in lowering\n",
      "cholesterol levels. Although the normal vitamin dose of\n",
      "niacin is only 20 mg, the dose required to reduce choles-\n",
      "terol levels is at least 500 mg each day. The mechanism\n",

      "serum cholesterol (TC) is the measurement routinely taken.\n",
      "Doctors sometimes order a complete lipoprotein profile to\n",
      "better evaluate the risk for atherosclerosis (coronary\n",
      "artery disease, or CAD). The full lipoprotein profile also\n",
      "includes measurements of triglyceride levels (a chemical\n",
      "compound that forms 95% of the fats and oils stored in ani-\n",
      "mal or vegetable cells) and lipoproteins (high density and\n",
      "low density). Blood fats are also called “lipids.”\n",
      "The type of cholesterol in the blood is as important as\n",
      "the total quantity. Cholesterol is a fatty substance and can-\n",
      "not be dissolved in water. It must combine with a protein\n",
      "molecule called a lipoprotein in order to be transported in\n",
      "the blood. There are five major types of lipoproteins in the\n",
      "human body; they differ in the amount of cholesterol that\n",
      "they carry in comparison to other fats and fatty acids, and\n",
      "in their functions in the body. Lipoproteins are classified,\n",
      "as follows, according to their density:\n",
      "• Chylomicrons. These are normally found in the blood\n",
      "only after a person has eaten foods containing fats.\n",
      "They contain about 7% cholesterol. Chylomicrons\n",
      "transport fats and cholesterol from the intestine into the\n",
      "liver and then into the bloodstream. They are metabo-\n",
      "lized in the process of carrying food energy to muscle\n",
      "and fat cells.\n",
      "• Very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). These lipopro-\n",
      "teins carry mostly triglycerides, but they also contain\n",
      "16–22% cholesterol. VLDLs are made in the liver and\n",
      "eventually become IDL particles after they have lost\n",
      "their triglyceride content.\n",
      "• Intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL). IDLs are\n",
      "short-lived lipoproteins containing about 30% choles-\n",
      "terol that are converted in the liver to low-density\n",
      "lipoproteins (LDLs).\n",
      "• Low-density lipoproteins (LDL). LDL molecules carry\n",
      "cholesterol from the liver to other body tissues. They\n",
      "contain about 50% cholesterol. Extra LDLs are absorbed\n",
      "by the liver and their cholesterol is excreted into the bile.\n",
      "LDL particles are involved in the formation of plaques\n",
      "(abnormal deposits of cholesterol) in the walls of the\n",
      "coronary arteries. LDL is known as “bad cholesterol.”\n",
      "• High-density lipoproteins (HDL). HDL molecules are\n",
      "made in the intestines and the liver. HDLs are about\n",
      "50% protein and 19% cholesterol. They help to remove\n",

      "Because of the difference in density and cholesterol\n",
      "content of lipoproteins, two patients with the same total\n",
      "cholesterol level can have very different lipid profiles\n",
      "and different risk for CAD. The critical factor is the level\n",
      "of HDL cholesterol in the blood serum. Some doctors\n",
      "use the ratio of the total cholesterol level to HDL choles-\n",
      "terol when assessing the patient’s degree of risk. A low\n",
      "TC/HDL ratio is associated with a lower degree of risk.\n",
      "Purpose\n",
      "The purpose of the TC test is to measure the levels\n",
      "of cholesterol in the patient’s blood. The patient’s choles-\n",
      "terol can also be fractionated (separated into different\n",
      "portions) in order to determine the TC/HDL ratio. The\n",

      "coronary artery disease (CAD). High LDL levels are\n",

      "Description\n",
      "Chronic kidney failure, also known as chronic renal\n",
      "failure, affects over 250,000 Americans annually. It is\n",
      "caused by a number of diseases and inherited disorders,\n",
      "but the progression of chronic kidney failure is always the\n",
      "same. The kidneys, which serve as the body’s natural fil-\n",
      "tration system, gradually lose their ability to remove flu-\n",
      "ids and waste products (urea) from the bloodstream. They\n",
      "also fail to regulate certain chemicals in the bloodstream,\n",
      "and deposit protein into the urine. Chronic kidney failure\n",
      "is irreversible, and will eventually lead to total kidney\n",
      "failure, also known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD).\n",
      "Without proper treatment intervention to remove wastes\n",
      "and fluids from the bloodstream, ESRD is fatal.\n",
      "Causes and symptoms\n",
      "Kidney failure is triggered by disease or a hereditary\n",
      "disorder in the kidneys. Both kidneys are typically affect-\n",
      "ed. The four most common causes of chronic kidney fail-\n",
      "ure include:\n",
      "• Diabetes. Diabetes mellitus (DM), both insulin depen-\n",
      "dant (IDDM) and non-insulin dependant (NIDDM),\n",
      "occurs when the body cannot produce and/or use\n",
      "insulin, the hormone necessary for the body to process\n",
      "glucose. Long-term diabetes may cause the glomeruli,\n",
      "the filtering units located in the nephrons of the kid-\n",
      "neys, to gradually lose functioning.\n",
      "• Glomerulonephritis . Glomerulonephritis is a chronic\n",
      "inflammation of the glomeruli, or filtering units of the\n",
      "kidney. Certain types of glomerulonephritis are treat-\n",
      "able, and may only cause a temporary disruption of kid-\n",
      "ney functioning.\n",
      "• Hypertension. High blood pressure is unique in that it\n",
      "is both a cause and a major symptom of kidney failure.\n",
      "The kidneys can become stressed and ultimately sustain\n",
      "permanent damage from blood pushing through them at\n",
      "an excessive level of pressure over a long period of time.\n",
      "• Polycystic kidney disease. Polycystic kidney disease is\n",
      "an inherited disorder that causes cysts to be formed on\n",
      "the nephrons, or functioning units, of the kidneys. The\n",
      "cysts hamper the regular functioning of the kidney.\n",
      "Other possible causes of chronic kidney failure\n",
      "include kidney cancer , obstructions such as kidney\n",
      "stones, pyelonephritis , reflux nephropathy, systemic\n",
      "lupus erythematosus , amyloidosis , sickle cell anemia,\n",
      "Alport syndrome, and oxalosis.\n",

      "ney failure may show few symptoms in spite of increased\n",
      "urea in their blood. Among the symptoms that may be\n",
      "present at this point are frequent urination during the\n",
      "night and high blood pressure.\n",
      "Most symptoms of chronic kidney failure are not\n",
      "apparent until kidney disease has progressed significant-\n",
      "ly. Common symptoms include:\n",
      "• Anemia. The kidneys are responsible for the production\n",
      "of erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone which stimulates red\n",
      "blood cell production. If kidney disease causes shrinking\n",
      "of the kidney, this red cell production is hampered.\n",
      "• Bad breath or a bad taste in mouth. Urea, or waste prod-\n",
      "ucts, in the saliva may cause an ammonia-like taste in\n",
      "the mouth.\n",
      "• Bone and joint problems. The kidneys produce vitamin\n",
      "D, which aids in the absorption of calcium and keeps\n",
      "bones strong. For patients with kidney failure, bones\n",
      "may become brittle, and in the case of children, normal\n",

      "• Edema. Puffiness or swelling around the eyes, arms,\n",
      "hands, and feet.\n",
      "• Frequent urination.\n",
      "• Foamy or bloody urine. Protein in the urine may cause\n",
      "it to foam significantly. Blood in the urine may indicate\n",
      "bleeding from diseased or obstructed kidneys, bladder,\n",
      "or ureters.\n",
      "• Headaches. High blood pressure may trigger headaches.\n",
      "• Hypertension, or high blood pressure. The retention of\n",
      "fluids and wastes causes blood volume to increase,\n",
      "which in turn, causes blood pressure to rise.\n",
      "• Increased fatigue. Toxic substances in the blood and the\n",

      "• Itching . Phosphorus, which is typically eliminated in\n",
      "the urine, accumulates in the blood of patients with kid-\n",

      "by cigarette smoking results in a narrowing of the open-\n",
      "ings in the bronchi, the large air tubes of the respiratory\n",
      "system, and interferes with the flow of air. Inflammation\n",

      "small hair-like projections that move bacteria and foreign\n",
      "particles out of the lungs, increasing the risk of infections.\n",
      "Emphysema\n",
      "Emphysema is a disease in which cigarette smoke\n",
      "causes an overproduction of the enzyme elastase, one of\n",
      "the immune system’s infection-fighting biochemicals.\n",
      "This results in irreversible destruction of a protein in the\n",
      "lung called elastin which is important for maintaining the\n",
      "structure of the walls of the alveoli, the terminal small air\n",
      "sacs of the respiratory system. As the walls of the alveoli\n",
      "rupture, the number of alveoli is reduced and many of\n",
      "those remaining are enlarged, making the lungs of the\n",
      "patient with emphysema less elastic and overinflated.\n",
      "Due to the higher pressure inside the chest that must be\n",
      "developed to force air out of the less-elastic lungs, the\n",

      "Causes and symptoms\n",
      "There are several important risk factors for COPD:\n",
      "• Lifestyle. Cigarette smoking is by far the most important\n",
      "risk factor for COPD (80% of all cases). Cigar and pipe\n",
      "smoking can also cause COPD. Air pollution and indus-\n",
      "trial dusts and fumes are other important risk factors.\n",
      "• Age. Chronic bronchitis is more common in people\n",
      "over 40 years old; emphysema occurs more often in\n",
      "people 65 years of age and older.\n",
      "• Socioeconomic class. COPD-related deaths are about\n",
      "twice as high among unskilled and semi-skilled labor-\n",
      "ers as among professionals.\n",
      "• Family clustering. It is thought that heredity predispos-\n",

      "deficiency of a blood component, an enzyme inhibitor\n",
      "called alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT). This type of emphysema\n",
      "is sometimes called “early onset emphysema” because it\n",
      "can appear when a person is as young as 30 or 40 years\n",

      "Definition\n",
      "Clubfoot is a condition in which one or both feet are\n",
      "twisted into an abnormal position at birth. The condition\n",
      "is also known as talipes.\n",
      "Description\n",
      "True clubfoot is characterized by abnormal bone for-\n",
      "mation in the foot. There are four variations of clubfoot,\n",
      "including talipes varus, talipes valgus, talipes equines,\n",
      "and talipes calcaneus. In talipes varus, the most common\n",
      "form of clubfoot, the foot generally turns inward so that\n",
      "the leg and foot look somewhat like the letter J. In talipes\n",
      "valgus, the foot rotates outward like the letter L. In tal-\n",
      "ipes equinus, the foot points downward, similar to that of\n",
      "a toe dancer. In talipes calcaneus, the foot points upward,\n",
      "with the heel pointing down.\n",
      "Clubfoot can affect one foot or both. Sometimes an\n",
      "infant’s feet appear abnormal at birth because of the\n",
      "intrauterine position of the fetus birth. If there is no\n",
      "anatomic abnormality of the bone, this is not true club-\n",
      "foot, and the problem can usually be corrected by apply-\n",
      "ing special braces or casts to straighten the foot.\n",
      "The ratio of males to females with clubfoot is 2.5 to\n",
      "1. The incidence of clubfoot varies only slightly. In the\n",
      "United States, the incidence is approximately 1 in every\n",
      "1,000 live births. A 1980 Danish study reported an over-\n",

      "that number had doubled to 2.41 in every 1,000 live\n",

      "Causes and symptoms\n",
      "Experts do not agree on the precise cause of club-\n",
      "foot. The exact genetic mechanism of inheritance has\n",
      "been extensively investigated using family studies and\n",
      "other epidemiological methods. As of 1999, no definitive\n",
      "conclusions had been reached, although a Mendelian pat-\n",

      "environmental factors. The MSX1 gene has been associ-\n",
      "ated with clubfoot in animal studies. But, as of 2001,\n",
      "these findings have not been replicated in humans.\n",
      "A family history of clubfoot has been reported in\n",
      "24.4% of families in a single study. These findings sug-\n",

      "compared to singleton births. Intrauterine exposure to\n",

      "Treatment\n",
      "Most orthopedic surgeons agree that the initial treat-\n",
      "ment of congenital (present at birth) clubfoot should be\n",
      "non-operative. Non-surgical treatment should begin in\n",
      "the first days of life to take advantage of the favorable\n",
      "fibro-elastic properties of the foot’s connective tissues,\n",
      "those forming the ligaments, joint capsules, and tendons.\n",
      "In a common treatment, a series of casts is applied over a\n",
      "period of months to reposition the foot into a normal\n",
      "alignment. In mild cases, splinting and wearing braces at\n",
      "night may correct the abnormality.\n",
      "When clubfoot is severe enough to require surgery,\n",
      "the condition is usually not completely correctable,\n",
      "although significant improvement is possible. In the most\n",
      "severe cases, surgery may be required, especially when\n",
      "the Achilles tendon, which joins the muscles in the calf\n",
      "to the bone of the heel, needs to be lengthened. Because\n",
      "an early operation induces fibrosis, a scarring and stiff-\n",
      "ness of the tissue, surgery should be delayed until an\n",
      "affected child is at least three months old.\n",
      "Much of a clubfoot abnormality can be corrected by\n",
      "the use of manipulation and casting during the first three\n",
      "months of life. Proper manipulative techniques must be\n",
      "followed by applications of appropriately molded plaster\n",
      "casts to provide effective and safe correction of most\n",
      "varieties of clubfoot. Long-term care by an orthopedist is\n",
      "required after initial treatment to ensure that the correc-\n",
      "tion of the abnormality is maintained. Exercises, correc-\n",
      "tive shoes, or nighttime splints may be needed until the\n",
      "child stops growing.\n",
      "Prognosis\n",
      "With prompt, expert treatment, clubfoot is usually\n",
      "correctable. Most individuals are able to wear regular\n",
      "shoes and lead active lives. If clubfoot is not appropriate-\n",

      "Cold sores are caused by a herpes virus. There are\n",
      "eight different kinds of human herpes viruses. Only two\n",
      "of these, herpes simplex types 1 and 2, can cause cold\n",
      "sores. It is commonly believed that herpes simplex virus\n",

      "type 2 infects below the waist. This is not completely\n",
      "true. Both herpes virus type 1 and type 2 can cause her-\n",
      "pes lesions on the lips or genitals, but recurrent cold\n",
      "sores are almost always type 1.\n",
      "Oral herpes is very common. More than 60% of\n",
      "Americans have had a cold sore, and almost 25% of\n",
      "those infected experience recurrent outbreaks. Most of\n",
      "these persons became infected before age 10. Anyone\n",
      "can become infected by herpes virus and, once infected,\n",
      "the virus remains latent for life. Herpes viruses are\n",

      "period beginning with the appearance of blisters and end-\n",

      "The herpes virus hides in the nervous system. This is\n",
      "called “latency.” A latent virus can wait inside the nervous\n",
      "system for days, months, or even years. At some future\n",
      "time, the virus “awakens” and causes the cell to produce\n",
      "thousands of new viruses that cause an active infection.\n",
      "This process of latency and active infection is best\n",

      "infection is obvious because cold sores are present. The\n",
      "first infection is called the “primary” infection. This active\n",
      "infection is then controlled by the body’s immune system\n",
      "and the sores heal. In between active infections, the virus\n",
      "is latent. At some point in the future, latent viruses become\n",
      "activated and once again cause sores. These are called\n",
      "“recurrent” infections. Although it is unknown what trig-\n",

      "Definition\n",
      "Colonic irrigation is also known as hydrotherapy of\n",
      "the colon, high colonic, entero-lavage, or simply colonic. It\n",
      "is the process of cleansing the colon by passing several gal-\n",
      "lons of water through it with the use of special equipment.\n",
      "It is similar to an enema but treats the whole colon, not just\n",
      "the lower bowel. This has the effect of flushing out impact-\n",
      "ed fecal matter, toxins, mucous, and even parasites that\n",
      "often build up over the passage of time. It is a procedure\n",
      "that should only be undertaken by a qualified practitioner.\n",
      "Purpose\n",
      "Anyone suffering from gas, bloating, cramping\n",
      "pains, acne and other skin complaints, arthritis, and a list\n",
      "of bowel complaints such as diverticulitis and irritable\n",
      "bowel etc., may benefit from colonic irrigation. In partic-\n",
      "ular,cancer patients are often advised to undertake a\n",
      "course of colonic irrigation sessions as an essential part\n",
      "of their treatment. When a biological cancer therapy\n",
      "begins to enable the body to breakdown a cancerous\n",
      "mass, it is essential that speedy and effective elimination\n",
      "of the resulting toxins is achieved.\n",
      "Colon and bowel cancer is one of the leading causes\n",
      "of death in the United States, and alternative practitioners\n",
      "insist that it can be prevented by efficient hygiene proce-\n",
      "dures. Providing that care is taken to replace the natural\n",
      "organisms that flourish in the bowel, many health benefits\n",
      "can be expected from colonic irrigation. In general, alter-\n",
      "native practitioners maintain that an ill-functioning bowel\n",
      "is the source of all disease, and therefore keeping it clean\n",
      "will be an effective protection against this.\n",
      "Removing large amounts of toxic matter relieves the\n",

      "Color blindness is an abnormal condition character-\n",
      "ized by the inability to clearly distinguish different colors\n",
      "of the spectrum. The difficulties can be mild to severe. It\n",
      "is a misleading term because people with color blindness\n",
      "are not blind. Rather, they tend to see colors in a limited\n",
      "range of hues; a rare few may not see colors at all.\n",
      "Description\n",
      "Normal color vision requires the use of specialized\n",
      "receptor cells called cones, which are located in the reti-\n",
      "na of the eye. There are three types of cones, termed red,\n",
      "blue, and green, which enable people to see a wide spec-\n",
      "trum of colors. An abnormality, or deficiency, of any of\n",
      "the types of cones will result in abnormal color vision.\n",
      "There are three basic variants of color blindness.\n",
      "Red/green color blindness (deuteranopia) is the most\n",
      "common deficiency, affecting 8% of Caucasian males\n",
      "and 0.5% of Caucasian females. The prevalence varies\n",
      "with culture.\n",
      "Blue color blindness (protanopia) is an inability to\n",
      "distinguish both blue and yellow, which are seen as white\n",
      "or gray. Protanopia is quite rare and has equal prevalence\n",
      "in males and females. It is common for young children to\n",
      "have blue/green confusion that becomes less pronounced\n",
      "in adulthood. Blue color deficiency often appears in peo-\n",
      "ple who have physical disorders such as liver disease or\n",
      "diabetes mellitus.\n",
      "A total inability to distinguish colors (achromatop-\n",
      "sia) is exceedingly rare. These affected individuals view\n",
      "the world in shades of gray. They frequently have poor\n",
      "visual acuity and are extremely sensitive to light (photo-\n",
      "phobia), which causes them to squint in ordinary light.\n",
      "Researchers studying red/green color blindness in\n",
      "the United Kingdom reported an average prevalence of\n",
      "only 4.7% in one group. Only 1% of Eskimo males are\n",

      "and females equally.\n",
      "Causes and symptoms\n",
      "Red/green and blue color blindness appear to be\n",
      "located on at least two different gene locations. The\n",
      "majority of affected individuals are males. Females are\n",

      "gene have a 50-50 chance of being color-blind. The rare\n",
      "female that has red/green color blindness, or rarer still,\n",
      "blue color blindness, indicates there is an involvement of\n",
      "another gene. As of 2001, the location of this gene has\n",
      "not been identified.\n",
      "Achromatopsia, the complete inability to distinguish\n",
      "color, is an autosomal recessive disease of the retina.\n",
      "This means that both parents have one copy of the altered\n",

      "increased. For example, the thalidomide tragedy of the\n",
      "early 1960s occurred after pregnant mothers in western\n",
      "Europe were given a tranquilizer containing the drug.\n",
      "The result was a drastic increase in the number of babies\n",
      "born with deformed limbs. In this example, the birth\n",

      "with more or less of their front side missing and open to\n",
      "the outside. At the same time, the front of the pelvic\n",

      "too. In fact, the defect often extends all the way to the\n",
      "penis in the male or splits the clitoris in the female.\n",

      "Description\n",
      "Congenital hip dysplasia is a disorder in children\n",
      "that is either present at birth or shortly thereafter. During\n",
      "gestation, the infant’s hip should be developing with the\n",
      "head of the thigh bone (femur) sitting perfectly centered\n",
      "in its shallow socket (acetabulum). The acetabulum\n",
      "should cover the head of the femur as if it were a ball sit-\n",
      "ting inside of a cup. In the event of congenital hip dyspla-\n",
      "sia, the development of the acetabulum in an infant\n",
      "allows the femoral head to ride upward out of the joint\n",

      "Clinical studies show a familial tendency toward hip\n",
      "dysplasia, with more females affected than males. This\n",
      "disorder is found in many cultures around the world.\n",
      "However, statistics show that the Native American popu-\n",
      "lation has a high incidence of hip dislocation. This has\n",
      "been documented to be due to the common practice of\n",
      "swaddling and using cradleboards for restraining the\n",
      "infants. This places the infant’s hips into extreme adduc-\n",

      "dysplasia is also higher in infants born by caesarian and\n",

      "Because the abnormalities of this hip problem often\n",
      "vary, a thorough physical examination is necessary for\n",

      "test, begins with each of the examiners’ hands around the\n",

      "down the child’s thigh. With the legs abducted (moved\n",
      "apart), the examiner may be able to discern a distinct\n",

      "Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) results when\n",
      "repeated exposure to an allergen (an allergy-causing sub-\n",
      "stance) triggers an immune response that inflames the\n",
      "skin. Tens of thousands of drugs, pesticides, cosmetics,\n",
      "food additives, commercial chemicals, and other sub-\n",
      "stances have been identified as potential allergens. Fewer\n",
      "than 30, however, are responsible the majority of ACD\n",
      "cases. Common culprits include poison ivy, poison oak,\n",
      "and poison sumac; fragrances and preservatives in cosmet-\n",
      "ics and personal care products; latex items such as gloves\n",
      "and condoms; and formaldehyde. Many people find that\n",
      "they are allergic to the nickel in inexpensive jewelry. ACD\n",
      "is usually confined to the area of skin that comes in contact\n",
      "with the allergen, typically the hands or face. Symptoms\n",
      "range from mild to severe and resemble those of ICD; a\n",
      "patch test may be needed to determine which kind of con-\n",
      "tact dermatitis a person is suffering from.\n",
      "Diagnosis\n",
      "Diagnosis begins with a physical examination and\n",
      "asking the patient questions about his or her health and\n",
      "daily activities. When contact dermatitis is suspected, the\n",
      "doctor attempts to learn as much as possible about the\n",
      "patient’s hobbies, workplace duties, use of medications\n",
      "and cosmetics, etc.—anything that might shed light on\n",
      "the source of the disease. In some cases, an examination\n",
      "of the home or workplace is undertaken. If the dermatitis\n",
      "is mild, responds well to treatment, and does not recur,\n",
      "ordinarily the investigation is at an end. More difficult\n",
      "cases require patch testing to identify the allergen.\n",
      "Two methods of patch testing are currently used. The\n",
      "most widely used method, the Finn chamber method,\n",
      "employs a multiwell, aluminum patch. Each well is filled\n",
      "with a small amount of the allergen being tested and the\n",
      "patch is taped to normal skin on the patient’s upper back.\n",
      "After 48 hours, the patch is removed and an initial reading\n",
      "is taken. A second reading is made a few days later. The\n",
      "second method of patch testing involves applying a small\n",
      "amount of the test substance to directly to normal skin\n",
      "and covering it with a dressing that keeps air out and\n",
      "keeps the test substance in (occlusive dressing). After 48\n",
      "hours, the dressing is taken off to see if a reaction has\n",
      "occurred. Identifying the allergen may require repeated\n",
      "testing, can take weeks or months, and is not always suc-\n",
      "cessful. Moreover, patch testing works only with ACD,\n",
      "though it is considered an essential step in ruling out ICD.\n",
      "Treatment\n",
      "The best treatment for contact dermatitis is to identify\n",
      "the allergen or irritating substance and avoid further con-\n",
      "tact with it. If the culprit is, for instance, a cosmetic, avoid-\n",
      "ance is a simple matter, but in some situations, such as an\n",

      "clothing such as gloves, masks, and long-sleeved shirts are\n",
      "ways of coping with contact dermatitis when avoidance is\n",
      "impossible, though they are not always effective.\n",
      "For the symptoms themselves, treatments in mild\n",

      "lotions and ointments. When the symptoms are severe,\n",

      "Birth control (contraception) is designed to interfere\n",
      "with the normal process and prevent the pregnancy that\n",

      "Although there are many different types of birth\n",

      "• Hormonal methods—These use medications (hor-\n",
      "mones) to prevent ovulation. Hormonal methods\n",
      "include birth control pills (oral contraceptives), Depo\n",
      "Provera injections and Norplant.\n",
      "• Barrier methods—These methods work by preventing\n",
      "the sperm from getting to and fertilizing the egg. Barri-\n",
      "er methods include the condom, diaphragm, and cervi-\n",
      "cal cap. The condom is the only form of birth control\n",
      "that also protects against sexually transmitted dis-\n",
      "eases, including HIV (the virus that causes AIDS).\n",
      "• Spermicides—These medications kill sperm on con-\n",
      "tact. Most spermicides contain nonoxynyl-9. Spermi-\n",
      "cides come in many different forms such as jelly, foam,\n",

      "the vagina. Spermicides work best when they are used\n",
      "at the same time as a barrier method.\n",
      "• Intrauterine devices—Intrauterine contraceptive\n",
      "devices (IUDs) are inserted into the uterus, where they\n",
      "stay from one to 10 years. An IUD prevents the fertil-\n",

      "is either tied or burned closed. The sperm cannot reach\n",
      "the egg, and the egg cannot travel to the uterus.\n",

      "Description\n",
      "The cornea is the clear, dome-shaped outer area of\n",
      "the eye. It lies in front of the colored part of the eye (iris)\n",
      "and the black hole in the iris (pupil). The outermost layer\n",
      "of the eyeball consists of the cornea and the white part of\n",
      "the eye (sclera). A corneal abrasion is basically a superfi-\n",
      "cial cut or scrape on the cornea. A corneal abrasion is not\n",
      "as serious as a corneal ulcer, which is generally deeper\n",
      "and more severe than an abrasion.\n",
      "Causes and symptoms\n",
      "A corneal abrasion is usually the result of direct injury\n",
      "to the eye, often from a fingernail scratch, makeup brushes,\n",
      "contact lenses, foreign body, or even twigs. Patients often\n",
      "complain of feeling a foreign body in their eye, and they\n",
      "may have pain, sensitivity to light, or tearing.\n",
      "Diagnosis\n",
      "Ophthalmologists and optometrists, who treat eye\n",
      "disorders, are well qualified to diagnose corneal abra-\n",
      "sions. The doctor will check the patient’s vision (visual\n",
      "acuity) in both eyes with an eye chart. A patient history\n",
      "will also be taken, which may help to determine the\n",
      "cause of the abrasion. A slit lamp, which is basically a\n",
      "microscope and light source, will allow the doctor to see\n",
      "the abrasion. Fluorescein, a yellow dye, may be placed\n",
      "into the eye to determine the extent of the abrasion. The\n",
      "fluorescein will temporarily stain the affected area.\n",
      "Treatment\n",
      "The cornea has a remarkable ability to heal itself, so\n",
      "treatment is designed to minimize complications. If the\n",
      "abrasion is very small, the doctor might just suggest an\n",
      "eye lubricant and a follow-up visit the next day. A very\n",
      "small abrasion should heal in one to two days; others\n",
      "usually in one week. However, to avoid a possible infec-\n",
      "tion, an antibiotic eye drop may be prescribed. Some-\n",
      "times additional eye drops may make the eye feel more\n",
      "comfortable. Depending upon the extent of the abrasion,\n",
      "some doctors may patch the affected eye. It is very\n",
      "important to go for the follow-up checkup to make sure\n",
      "an infection does not occur. Use of contact lenses should\n",
      "not be resumed without the doctor’s approval.\n",
      "Prognosis\n",
      "In typical cases, the prognosis is good. The cornea\n",
      "will heal itself, usually within several days. A very deep\n",
      "abrasion may lead to scarring. If the abrasion does not\n",
      "heal properly, a recurrent corneal erosion (RCE) may\n",
      "result months or even years later. The symptoms are the\n",
      "same as for an abrasion (e.g., tearing, foreign body sensa-\n",

      "lar or additional treatment for the RCE may be necessary.\n",
      "Prevention\n",

      "Description\n",
      "The cornea is the transparent layer of tissue at the\n",

      "adequate tears and a functioning eyelid. They gain access\n",
      "because injury has impaired these defense mechanisms.\n",

      "the other way to make the eye vulnerable to infection.\n",

      "and other substances to help protect against infection.\n",
      "Certain diseases dry up tear production, leaving the\n",

      "Coronary artery disease, also called coronary heart\n",
      "disease or heart disease, is the leading cause of death for\n",
      "both men and women in the United States. According to\n",
      "the American Heart Association, in 1995 one in every 4.8\n",
      "deaths in the United States was caused by coronary artery\n",
      "disease. About every 29 seconds, one American will have\n",
      "a heart attack; about every minute, one American will die\n",
      "from a heart attack. Fourteen million Americans have\n",
      "active symptoms of coronary artery disease (heart attack\n",
      "or chest pains). Many millions more have silent coronary\n",
      "disease, the first indication of which can be sudden death.\n",
      "Coronary artery disease occurs when the coronary\n",
      "arteries become partially blocked or clogged. This block-\n",
      "age limits the flow of blood from the coronary arteries,\n",
      "which are the major arteries supplying oxygen-rich blood\n",
      "to the heart. The coronary arteries expand when the heart\n",
      "is working harder and needs more oxygen. Arteries\n",
      "would expand, for example, when a person is climbing\n",
      "stairs, exercising, or having sex. If the arteries are unable\n",
      "to expand, the heart is deprived of oxygen (myocardial\n",
      "ischemia). When the blockage is limited, chest pain or\n",
      "pressure, called angina, may occur. When the blockage\n",
      "cuts off the flow of blood, the result is heart attack\n",
      "(myocardial infarction or heart muscle death).\n",
      "Healthy coronary arteries are clean, smooth, and\n",

      "The disease process in arteries is thought to begin with\n",
      "an injury to the linings and walls of the arteries. This\n",

      "Definition\n",
      "A coronary stent is an artificial support device used\n",

      "Purpose\n",
      "The coronary stent is a relatively new tool used to\n",
      "keep coronary arteries expanded, usually following a bal-\n",
      "loon angioplasty. Balloon angioplasty is used in patients\n",
      "with coronary artery disease . In this disease, the blood\n",
      "vessels on the heart become narrow. When this happens,\n",
      "the oxygen supply is reduced to the heart muscle. The\n",
      "primary cause of coronary artery disease is fat deposits\n",
      "blocking the arteries (atherosclerosis ). In many cases,\n",
      "balloon angioplasty is unsuccessful and the vessel closes\n",
      "after the procedure (restenosis). By forming a rigid sup-\n",
      "port, the stent can prevent restenosis and reduce the need\n",
      "for coronary bypass surgery. The stent is usually a stain-\n",
      "less steel mesh tube. Since the stent will be placed inside\n",
      "an artery, the device comes in various sizes to match the\n",

      "Description\n",
      "Coronary stenting usually follows balloon angio-\n",
      "plasty, which requires inserting a balloon catheter into\n",
      "the femoral artery in the upper thigh. When this catheter\n",
      "is positioned at the location of the blockage in the coro-\n",
      "nary artery, it is slowly inflated to widen that artery, and\n",
      "is then removed. The stent catheter is then threaded into\n",
      "the artery and the stent is placed around a deflated bal-\n",
      "loon. When this is correctly positioned in the coronary\n",
      "artery, the balloon is inflated, expanding the stent against\n",
      "the walls of the coronary artery. The balloon catheter is\n",
      "removed, leaving the stent in place to hold the coronary\n",

      "A cough is a forceful release of air from the lungs\n",

      "Description\n",
      "While people can generally cough voluntarily, a\n",
      "cough is usually a reflex triggered when an irritant stim-\n",
      "ulates one or more of the cough receptors found at dif-\n",
      "ferent points in the respiratory system. These receptors\n",
      "then send a message to the cough center in the brain,\n",
      "which in turn tells the body to cough. A cough begins\n",
      "with a deep breath in, at which point the opening\n",
      "between the vocal cords at the upper part of the larynx\n",
      "(glottis) shuts, trapping the air in the lungs. As the\n",
      "diaphragm and other muscles involved in breathing\n",
      "press against the lungs, the glottis suddenly opens, pro-\n",
      "ducing an explosive outflow of air at speeds greater than\n",
      "100 mi (160 km) per hour.\n",
      "In normal situations, most people cough once or\n",
      "twice an hour during the day to clear the airway of irri-\n",
      "tants. However, when the level of irritants in the air is\n",
      "high or when the respiratory system becomes infected,\n",

      "agent that is. Originally assumed to be a virus, evidence\n",
      "is accumulating that, instead, CJD is caused by a protein\n",
      "called a prion (PREE-on, for “proteinaceous infectious\n",
      "particle”) transmitted from victim to victim. The other\n",
      "spongiform encephalopathies are also hypothesized to be\n",
      "due to prion infection.\n",

      "one of the most radical new ideas in biology since the\n",
      "discovery of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). All infec-\n",
      "tious diseases, in fact all life, uses nucleic acids—DNA\n",
      "or ribonucleic acid (RNA)—to code the instructions\n",
      "needed for reproduction. Inactivation of the nucleic acids\n",
      "destroys the capacity to reproduce. However, when these\n",
      "same measures are applied to infected tissue from\n",
      "spongiform encephalopathy victims, infectivity is not\n",
      "destroyed. Furthermore, purification of infected tissue to\n",

      "nucleic acid. While it remains possible that some highly\n",

      "protein, this is seemingly less and less likely as further\n",
      "experiments are done. The “prion hypothesis,” as it is\n",
      "called, is now widely accepted, at least provisionally, by\n",
      "most researchers in the field. The most vocal proponent\n",
      "of the hypothesis, Stanley Prusiner, was awarded the\n",
      "Nobel Prize in 1997 for his work in the prion diseases.\n",
      "A prion is an altered form of a normal brain protein.\n",
      "The normal protein has a helical shape along part of its\n",
      "length. In the prion form, a sheet structure replaces the\n",
      "helix. According to the hypothesis, when the normal\n",
      "form interacts with the prion form, some of its helical\n",
      "part is converted to a sheet, thus creating a new prion\n",
      "capable of transforming other normal forms. In this way,\n",

      "part of the membrane of brain cells, but its exact function\n",

      "to swelling, redness, and loss of normal function. There\n",

      "products of the immune system that attack the body itself\n",
      "instead of helpfully attacking a foreign invader (a virus\n",
      "or bacteria, for example). The inflammation of Crohn’s\n",

      "large intestine (the colon). However, inflammation may\n",

      "may be separated by normal, unaffected segments of\n",
      "intestine. The affected areas are called “regional enteri-\n",
      "tis,” while the normal areas are called “skip areas.”\n",
      "• The inflammation of Crohn’s disease affects all the lay-\n",

      "only the lining of the intestine.\n",
      "Also, ulcerative colitis does not usually involve the\n",
      "small intestine; in rare cases it involves the terminal\n",
      "ileum (so-called “backwash” ileitis).\n",
      "In addition to inflammation, Crohn’s disease causes\n",

      "Definition\n",
      "Cryotherapy is a technique that uses an extremely\n",

      "use since the turn of the century, but modern techniques\n",
      "have made it widely available to dermatologists and pri-\n",
      "mary care doctors. The technique is also called\n",
      "cryosurgery.\n",
      "Purpose\n",
      "Cryotherapy can be employed to destroy a variety of\n",
      "benign skin growths, such as warts, pre-cancerous lesions\n",
      "(such as actinic keratoses), and malignant lesions (such as\n",
      "basal cell and squamous cell cancers). The goal of\n",
      "cryotherapy is to freeze and destroy targeted skin growths\n",
      "while preserving the surrounding skin from injury.\n",
      "Precautions\n",
      "Cryotherapy is not recommended for certain areas of\n",
      "the body because of the danger of destruction of tissue or\n",
      "unacceptable scarring. These areas include: skin that\n",

      "Description\n",
      "Cutaneous larvae migrans (also called “creeping\n",
      "eruption” or “ground itch”) is found in southeastern and\n",
      "Gulf states, and in tropical developing countries.\n",
      "The hookworms that cause the condition are small,\n",
      "round blood-sucking worms that infest about 700 million\n",

      "beneath raised buildings, and sunbathers who lie down\n",
      "on wet sand contaminated with hookworm larvae.\n",
      "Causes and symptoms\n",
      "After an animal passes feces that are infested with\n",
      "hookworm eggs, the eggs hatch into infective larvae that\n",
      "are able to penetrate human skin (even through solid\n",
      "material, such as a beach towel). The larvae are common-\n",
      "ly found in shaded, moist, or sandy areas (such as beach-\n",
      "es, a child’s sandbox, or areas underneath a house),\n",
      "where they are easily picked up by bare feet or buttocks.\n",
      "In minor infestations, there may be no symptoms at\n",
      "all. In more severe cases, a red elevation of the skin\n",
      "(papule) appears within a few hours after the larvae have\n",
      "penetrated the skin. This usually arises first in areas that\n",
      "are in contact with the soil, such as the feet, hands, and\n",
      "buttocks.\n",
      "Between a few days and a few months after infec-\n",

      "blisters. These red lines usually appear at the top of the\n",
      "sole of the foot or on the buttocks.\n",
      "Tyically, the larvae travel through the bloodstream, to\n",

      "Definition\n",
      "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease that\n",
      "affects the lungs, digestive system, sweat glands, and\n",
      "male fertility. Its name derives from the fibrous scar tis-\n",
      "sue that develops in the pancreas, one of the principal\n",
      "organs affected by the disease.\n",
      "Description\n",
      "Cystic fibrosis affects the body’s ability to move salt\n",
      "and water in and out of cells. This defect causes the lungs\n",
      "and pancreas to secrete thick mucus, blocking passage-\n",
      "ways and preventing proper function.\n",
      "CF affects approximately 30,000 children and young\n",
      "adults in the United States, and about 3,000 babies are\n",
      "born with CF every year. CF primarily affects people of\n",
      "white northern-European descent; rates are much lower\n",
      "in non-white populations.\n",
      "Many of the symptoms of CF can be treated with\n",
      "drugs or nutritional supplements. Close attention to and\n",
      "prompt treatment of respiratory and digestive complica-\n",
      "tions have dramatically increased the expected life span\n",
      "of a person with CF. While several decades ago most\n",
      "children with CF died by age two, today about half of all\n",
      "people with CF live past age 31. That median age is\n",
      "expected to grow as new treatments are developed, and it\n",
      "is estimated that a person born in 1998 with CF has a\n",
      "median expected life span of 40 years.\n",
      "Causes and symptoms\n",
      "Causes\n",
      "Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease, meaning it is\n",
      "caused by a defect in the person’s genes. Genes, found in\n",
      "the nucleus of all the body’s cells, control cell function\n",
      "by serving as the blueprint for the production of proteins.\n",
      "Proteins carry out a wide variety of functions within\n",
      "cells. The gene that, when defective, causes CF, is called\n",
      "the CFTR gene, which stands for cystic fibrosis trans-\n",
      "membrane conductance regulator. A simple defect in this\n",
      "gene leads to all the consequences of CF. There are over\n",
      "500 known defects in the CFTR gene that can cause CF.\n",
      "However, 70% of all people with a defective CFTR gene\n",
      "have the same defect, known as delta-F508.\n",
      "Much as sentences are composed of long strings of\n",
      "words, each made of letters; genes can be thought of as\n",
      "long strings of chemical words, each made of chemical\n",
      "letters, called nucleotides. Just as a sentence can be\n",
      "changed by rearranging its letters, genes can be mutated,\n",
      "or changed, by changes in the sequence of their\n",
      "nucleotide letters. The gene defects in CF are called\n",
      "point mutations, meaning that the gene is mutated only at\n",
      "one small spot along its length. In other words, the delta-\n",
      "F508 mutation is a loss of one “letter” out of thousands\n",
      "within the CFTR gene. As a result, the CFTR protein\n",
      "made from its blueprint is made incorrectly, and cannot\n",
      "perform its function properly.\n",
      "The CFTR protein helps to produce mucus. Mucus is\n",
      "a complex mixture of salts, water, sugars, and proteins that\n",
      "cleanses, lubricates, and protects many passageways in the\n",
      "body, including those in the lungs and pancreas. The role\n",
      "of the CFTR protein is to allow chloride ions to exit the\n",
      "mucus-producing cells. When the chloride ions leave these\n",
      "cells, water follows, thinning the mucus. In this way, the\n",
      "CFTR protein helps to keep mucus from becoming thick\n",
      "and sluggish, thus allowing the mucus to be moved steadi-\n",
      "ly along the passageways to aid in cleansing.\n",
      "In CF, the CFTR protein cannot allow chloride ions\n",
      "out of the mucus-producing cells. With less chloride\n",
      "leaving, less water leaves, and the mucus becomes thick\n",
      "and sticky. It can no longer move freely through the pas-\n",
      "sageways, so they become clogged. In the pancreas,\n",
      "clogged passageways prevent secretion of digestive\n",
      "enzymes into the intestine, causing serious impairment\n",
      "of digestion—especially of fat—which may lead to mal-\n",
      "nutrition. Mucus in the lungs may plug the airways, pre-\n",
      "venting good air exchange and, ultimately, leading to\n",
      "emphysema. The mucus is also a rich source of nutrients\n",
      "for bacteria, leading to frequent infections.\n",
      "INHERITANCE OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS. To understand\n",
      "the inheritance pattern of CF, it is important to realize that\n",

      "Definition\n",
      "Cystinuria is an inborn error of amino acid transport\n",
      "that results in the defective absorption by the kidneys of\n",
      "the amino acid called cystine. The name means “cystine\n",
      "in the urine.”\n",
      "Description\n",
      "Cystine is an amino acid. Amino acids are organic\n",
      "compounds needed by the body to make proteins and for\n",
      "many normal functions. When the kidneys don’t absorb\n",
      "cystine, this compound builds up in the urine. When the\n",
      "amount of cystine in the urine exceeds its solubility (the\n",
      "greatest amount that can be dissolved), crystals form. As\n",
      "the amount of cystine continues to increase in the urine,\n",
      "the number of crystals also increases. When very large\n",
      "numbers of cystine crystals form, they clump together\n",
      "into what is called a stone.\n",
      "Causes and symptoms\n",
      "Cystinuria is a rare disease that occurs when people\n",
      "inherit an abnormal gene from their parents. This disease\n",
      "occurs in differing degrees of severity in people who\n",
      "have inherited either one or two abnormal genes.\n",
      "Humans have two copies of each gene. When both are\n",
      "abnormal, the condition is called homozygous for the\n",
      "disease. When one copy is normal and the other is abnor-\n",
      "mal, the condition is called heterozygous for the disease.\n",
      "Persons with one abnormal gene can have a milder form\n",
      "of cystinuria that rarely results in the formation of stones.\n",
      "Severe cystinuria occurs when people are homozy-\n",
      "gous for the disease. For these individuals, the kidneys\n",
      "may excrete as much as 30 times the normal amount of\n",
      "cystine. Research has shown that this condition is caused\n",
      "by mutations on chromosome number two (humans have\n",
      "23 pairs of chromosomes).\n",
      "A person who has inherited cystinuria may have\n",
      "other abnormal bodily functions. In addition to excess\n",
      "levels of the amino acid cystine, high amounts of the\n",
      "amino acids lysine, arginine, and ornithine are found in\n",
      "the urine. This condition indicates that these amino acids\n",
      "are not being reabsorbed by the body.\n",
      "When excess cystine crystals clump together to form\n",
      "a stone, the stone can block portions of the interior of the\n",
      "kidney or the tube (the ureter) that connects the kidney to\n",
      "the urinary bladder. These cystine stones can be painful,\n",
      "and depending upon where the stone becomes trapped,\n",
      "the pain can be felt in the lower back or the abdomen.\n",
      "Nausea and vomiting can also occur, and patients may\n",
      "sometimes feel the need to urinate often. Cystine stones\n",
      "can also cause blood in the urine. When the urinary tract\n",
      "is blocked by a stone, urinary tract infections or kidney\n",
      "failure may result.\n",
      "Diagnosis\n",
      "Small stones (called “silent”) often do not cause any\n",
      "symptoms, although they can be detected by an x ray.\n",
      "Large stones are often painful and easily noticed by the\n",
      "patient. Blood in the urine can also mean that a stone has\n",
      "formed.\n",
      "When the urine contains extremely high amounts of\n",
      "cystine, yellow-brown hexagonal crystals are visible\n",
      "when a sample is examined under the microscope. Urine\n",

      "liquid each day (about 5–7 qts) to produce at least 8 pts\n",

      "Definition\n",
      "Dacryocystitis is an inflammation of the tear sac\n",
      "(lacrimal sac) at the inner corner of the eye.\n",
      "Description\n",
      "Tears drain into little openings (puncta) in the inner\n",
      "corners of the eyelids. From there, the tears travel\n",
      "through little tube-like structures (canaliculi) to the\n",
      "lacrimal sac. The nasolacrimal ducts then take the tears\n",
      "from the lacrimal sac to the nose. That’s why people\n",
      "need to blow their nose when they cry a lot.\n",
      "Dacryocystitis is usually caused by a blockage of\n",
      "the nasolacrimal duct, which allows fluid to drain into\n",
      "the nasal passages. When the lacrimal sac does not\n",
      "drain, bacteria can grow in the trapped fluid. This con-\n",
      "dition is most common in infants and people over 40\n",
      "years old.\n",
      "Causes and symptoms\n",
      "In newborn infants, the nasolacrimal duct may fail to\n",
      "form an opening—a condition called dacryostenosis. The\n",
      "cause of dacryocystitis in adults is usually associated\n",
      "with inflammation and infection in the nasal region.\n",
      "Dacryocystitis can be acute, having a sudden onset, or it\n",
      "can be chronic, with symptoms occurring over the course\n",
      "of weeks or months. Symptoms of acute dacryocystitis\n",
      "can include pain, redness, tearing, and swelling at the\n",
      "inner corner of the eye by the nose. In chronic dacryocys-\n",
      "titis, the eye area may be swollen, watery or teary, and,\n",
      "when pressure is applied to the area, there may be a dis-\n",
      "charge of pus or mucus through the punctum.\n",
      "Diagnosis\n",
      "Dacryocystitis usually occurs in only one eye. As\n",
      "mentioned, the symptoms can range from watery eyes,\n",
      "pain, swelling, and redness to a discharge of pus when\n",
      "pressure is applied to the area between the bridge of the\n",
      "nose and the inner eyelids. A sample of the pus may be\n",
      "collected on a swab or in a tube for laboratory analysis.\n",
      "The type of antibiotic and treatment may depend on\n",

      "Definition\n",
      "Debridement is the process of removing non-living\n",
      "tissue from pressure ulcers, burns, and other wounds.\n",
      "Purpose\n",
      "Debridement speeds the healing of pressure ulcers,\n",
      "burns, and other wounds. Wounds that contain non-living\n",
      "(necrotic) tissue take longer to heal. The necrotic tissue\n",
      "may become colonized with bacteria, producing an\n",
      "unpleasant odor. Though the wound is not necessarily\n",
      "infected, the bacteria can cause inflammation and strain\n",
      "the body’s ability to fight infection. Necrotic tissue may\n",
      "also hide pockets of pus called abscesses. Abscesses can\n",
      "develop into a general infection that may lead to ampu-\n",
      "tation or death.\n",
      "Precautions\n",
      "Not all wounds need debridement. Sometimes it is\n",
      "better to leave a hardened crust of dead tissue, called an\n",
      "eschar, than to remove it and create an open wound, partic-\n",
      "ularly if the crust is stable and the wound is not inflamed.\n",
      "Before performing debridement, the physician will take a\n",
      "medical history with attention to factors that might com-\n",
      "plicate healing, such as medications being taken and\n",
      "smoking. The physician will also note the cause of the\n",
      "wound and the ways it has been treated. Some ulcers and\n",
      "other wounds occur in places where blood flow is\n",
      "impaired, for example, the foot ulcers that can accompany\n",
      "diabetes mellitus. In such cases, the physician or nurse\n",
      "may decide not to debride the wound because blood flow\n",
      "may be insufficient for proper healing.\n",
      "Description\n",
      "In debridement, dead tissue is removed so that the\n",
      "remaining living tissue can adequately heal. Dead tissue\n",
      "exposed to the air will form a hard black crust, called an\n",

      "debridement is generally performed by a physician, but\n",
      "in some areas of the country an advance practice nurse or\n",

      "The physician will begin by flushing the area with a\n",

      "According to the Divers Alert Network (DAN), a\n",

      "and promotion, less than 1% of divers fall victim to DCS\n",
      "or the rarer bubble problem called gas embolism , air\n",

      "United States military community in Okinawa, where tens\n",
      "of thousands of sport and military dives are made each\n",
      "year, identified 84 DCS and 10 AGE cases in 1989–95,\n",
      "including nine deaths. This translated into estimates of one\n",

      "dives. DCS symptoms can be quite mild, however, and\n",
      "many cases certainly go unnoticed by divers.\n",
      "At times the terminology adopted by writers on\n",
      "DCS can be confusing. Some substitute the term\n",
      "decompression illness (DCI) for DCS. Others treat DCI\n",
      "as a label encompassing both DCS and AGE. An older\n",
      "term for DCS is caisson disease, coined in the nine-\n",

      "experiencing joint pain (a typical DCS symptom) on\n",
      "returning to the surface.\n",
      "Causes and symptoms\n",
      "The air we breathe is mostly a mixture of two gases,\n",
      "nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%). Unlike oxygen, nitro-\n",
      "gen is a biologically inert gas, meaning that it is not\n",
      "metabolized (converted into other substances) by the\n",
      "body. For this reason, most of the nitrogen we inhale is\n",
      "expelled when we exhale, but some is dissolved into the\n",
      "blood and other tissues. During a dive, however, the\n",
      "lungs take in more nitrogen than usual. This happens\n",
      "because the surrounding water pressure is greater than\n",
      "the air pressure at sea level (twice as great at 33 ft [10 m],\n",
      "for instance). As the water pressure increases, so does the\n",
      "pressure of the nitrogen in the compressed air inhaled by\n",
      "the diver. Because increased pressure causes an increase\n",
      "in gas density, the diver takes in more nitrogen with each\n",
      "breath than he or she would at sea level. Instead of being\n",
      "exhaled, however, the extra nitrogen safely dissolves into\n",
      "the tissues, where it remains until the diver begins his or\n",
      "her return to the surface (under some circumstances the\n",
      "extra nitrogen can cause nitrogen narcosis, but that con-\n",
      "dition is distinct from DCS). On the way up, decompres-\n",
      "sion occurs (in other words, the water pressure drops),\n",
      "and with the change in pressure, the extra nitrogen grad-\n",
      "ually diffuses out of the tissues and is delivered by the\n",
      "bloodstream to the lungs, which expel it from the body. If\n",
      "the diver surfaces too quickly, however, potentially dan-\n",
      "gerous nitrogen bubbles can form in the tissues and cause\n",
      "DCS. These bubbles can compress nerves, obstruct arter-\n",
      "ies, veins, and lymphatic vessels, and trigger harmful\n",
      "chemical reactions in the blood. The precise reasons for\n",
      "bubble formation remain unclear.\n",
      "How much extra nitrogen enters the tissues varies\n",
      "with the dive’s depth and duration. Dive tables prepared\n",
      "by the U.S. Navy and other organizations specify how\n",
      "long most divers can safely remain at a particular depth.\n",
      "If the dive table limits are exceeded, the diver must pause\n",
      "on the way up to allow the nitrogen to diffuse into the\n",
      "bloodstream without forming bubbles; these pauses are\n",
      "called decompression stops, and are carefully calibrated.\n",
      "DCS can occur, however, even when a diver obeys safe\n",
      "diving rules. In such cases, the predisposing factors\n",
      "include fatigue , obesity , dehydration , hypothermia ,\n",
      "and recent alcohol use. As well, people who fly or travel\n",
      "to high-altitude locations without letting 12–24 hours\n",
      "pass after their last dive are at risk for DCS as well\n",
      "because their bodies undergo further decompression.\n",
      "This is true even when flying in commercial aircraft.\n",
      "Many travelers are unaware that to save money on fuel\n",
      "the cabin pressure in commercial aircraft is set much\n",
      "lower than the pressure at sea level. At 30,000 ft (9,144\n",
      "m), for instance, cabin pressure is usually equivalent to\n",
      "the pressure at 7,000–8,000 ft (2,133–2,438 m) above sea\n",
      "level, a safe setting for everyone but recent divers. Exact-\n",
      "ly how long a diver should wait before flying or traveling\n",
      "to a high-altitude location depends on how much diving\n",
      "he or she has done and other considerations. If there is\n",
      "uncertainty about the appropriate waiting period, the sen-\n",
      "sible course of action is to let the full 24 hours pass.\n",
      "Because the nitrogen bubbles that cause DCS can\n",
      "affect any of the body’s tissues, including the blood,\n",
      "bones, nerves, and muscles, many kinds of symptoms are\n",
      "possible. Symptoms can appear minutes after a diver sur-\n",
      "faces, and in about 80% of cases do so within eight\n",
      "hours. Pain is often the only symptom; this is sometimes\n",
      "called the bends, although many people incorrectly use\n",
      "that term as a synonym for DCS itself. The pain, which\n",
      "ranges from mild to severe, is usually limited to the\n",
      "joints, but can be felt anywhere. Severe itching (pruritis),\n",
      "skin rashes, and skin mottling (cutis marmorata) are\n",

      "Dementia is a loss of mental ability severe enough to\n",

      "more than six months, not present since birth, and not\n",
      "associated with a loss or alteration of consciousness.\n",
      "Description\n",
      "Dementia is a group of symptoms caused by gradual\n",
      "death of brain cells. The loss of cognitive abilities that\n",
      "occurs with dementia leads to impairments in memory,\n",
      "reasoning, planning, and personality. While the over-\n",
      "whelming number of people with dementia are elderly, it\n",
      "is not an inevitable part of aging. Instead, dementia is\n",
      "caused by specific brain diseases. Alzheimer’s disease\n",
      "(AD) is the most common cause, followed by vascular or\n",
      "multi-infarct dementia.\n",
      "The prevalence of dementia has been difficult to\n",
      "determine, partly because of differences in definition\n",
      "among different studies, and partly because there is some\n",
      "normal decline in functional ability with age. Dementia\n",
      "affects 5–8% of all people between ages 65 and 74, and\n",
      "up to 20% of those between 75 and 84. Estimates for\n",
      "dementia in those 85 and over range from 30–47%.\n",
      "Between two and four million Americans have AD; that\n",
      "number is expected to grow to as many as 14 million by\n",
      "the middle of the twenty-first century as the population\n",
      "as a whole ages.\n",
      "The cost of dementia can be considerable. While\n",
      "most people with dementia are retired and do not suffer\n",
      "income losses from their disease, the cost of care is often\n",
      "enormous. Financial burdens include lost wages for fam-\n",
      "ily caregivers, medical supplies and drugs, and home\n",
      "modifications to ensure safety. Nursing home care may\n",
      "cost several thousand dollars a month or more. The psy-\n",
      "chological cost is not as easily quantifiable but can be\n",
      "even more profound. The person with dementia loses\n",
      "control of many of the essential features of his life and\n",
      "personality, and loved ones lose a family member even as\n",
      "they continue to cope with the burdens of increasing\n",

      "Causes and symptoms\n",
      "Causes\n",
      "Dementia is usually caused by degeneration in the\n",
      "cerebral cortex, the part of the brain responsible for\n",
      "thoughts, memories, actions and personality. Death of\n",
      "brain cells in this region leads to the cognitive impair-\n",
      "ment which characterizes dementia.\n",
      "The most common cause of dementia is AD,\n",
      "accounting for half to three quarters of all cases. The\n",
      "brain of a person with AD becomes clogged with two\n",
      "abnormal structures, called neurofibrillary tangles and\n",
      "senile plaques. Neurofibrillary tangles are twisted masses\n",
      "of protein fibers inside nerve cells, or neurons. Senile\n",
      "plaques are composed of parts of neurons surrounding a\n",
      "group of proteins called beta-amyloid deposits. Why\n",
      "these structures develop is unknown. Current research\n",
      "indicates possible roles for inflammation, blood flow\n",
      "restriction, and toxic molecular fragments known as free\n",
      "radicals. Several genes have been associated with higher\n",
      "incidences of AD, although the exact role of these genes\n",
      "is still unknown.\n",
      "Vascular dementia is estimated to cause from 5–30%\n",
      "of all dementias. It occurs from decrease in blood flow to\n",
      "the brain, most commonly due to a series of small strokes\n",

      "plan activities, and to draw simple conclusions from facts.\n",
      "• Language and comprehension disturbances. The person\n",
      "may be unable to understand instructions, or follow the\n",

      "notes that environmental factors can play a significant role\n",
      "in many illnesses. Environmental medicine is a field that\n",

      "{'source': 'data\\\\The_GALE_ENCYCLOPEDIA_of_MEDICINE_SECOND.pdf', 'page': 431}\n",
      "Description\n",
      "The nasal septum is composed of two parts. Toward\n",
      "the back of the head the nasal septum is rigid bone, but\n",
      "further forward the bone becomes cartilage. With one\n",
      "finger in each nostril this cartilage can easily be bent\n",
      "back and forth. If the nasal septum is sufficiently dis-\n",
      "placed to one side, it will impede the flow of air and\n",
      "mucus through the nose. This condition, called a deviat-\n",
      "ed septum, can cause symptoms and disease.\n",
      "Causes and symptoms\n",
      "A deviated septum can be a simple variation in nor-\n",
      "mal structure or the result of a broken nose. Any narrow-\n",
      "ing of the nasal passageway that it causes will threaten\n",
      "the drainage of secretions from the sinuses, which must\n",
      "pass through the nose. It is a general rule of medicine\n",
      "that when flow is obstructed, whether it is mucus from\n",
      "the sinuses or bile from the gall bladder, infection results.\n",
      "People with allergic rhinitis (hay fever) are at greater\n",
      "risk of obstruction because their nasal passageways are\n",
      "already narrowed by the swollen membranes lining them.\n",
      "The result is sinusitis, which can be acute and severe or\n",
      "chronic and lingering.\n",
      "Diagnosis\n",
      "It is easy to see that a septum is deviated. It is more\n",
      "difficult to determine if that deviation needs correction. It\n",
      "is common for a patient to complain that he/she can\n",
      "breathe through only one nostril. Then the diagnosis is\n",
      "easy. A deviated septum may also contribute to snoring,\n",
      "sleep apnea, and other breathing disorders.\n",
      "Treatment\n",
      "The definitive treatment is surgical repositioning of\n",
      "the septum, accomplished by breaking it loose and fixing\n",
      "it in a proper place while it heals. Decongestants like\n",
      "pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine will shrink the\n",
      "membranes and thereby enlarge the passages. Antihista-\n",
      "mines, nasal cortisone spray, and other allergy treat-\n",
      "ments may also be temporarily beneficial.\n",
      "Alternative treatment\n",
      "As a palliative, saline drops and sprays are very help-\n",
      "ful in loosening mucus in the obstructed side and prevent-\n",
      "ing drying in the other side, where all the air blows. Hot\n",
      "peppers, such as jalapenos, can produce enough tears and\n",
      "discharge to flush out a stopped-up nose. An even more\n",
      "effective treatment is called a nasal lavage, often done\n",
      "using a small pot with a spout. Saline solution is poured\n",
      "into one nostril and allowed to flow out the other nostril.\n",
      "Then, the process is repeated in reverse. These therapies\n",
      "are all useful to take care of symptoms, but do not correct\n",
      "the problem. Nasospecific, a procedure where a deflated\n",
      "balloon is inserted in the nostril and inflated to a large\n",
      "enough degree to adjust the septal deviation, can be an\n",
      "alternative to surgery. A trained practitioner in the\n",
      "nasospecific procedure is necessary.\n",
      "Prognosis\n",
      "Surgical repair is curative and carries little risk.\n",
      "Chronic infection can be painful and lead to complica-\n",

      "the infection will very likely return.\n",
      "Prevention\n",

      "Background\n",
      "Every cell in the human body needs energy in order\n",

      "cose, a simple sugar resulting from the digestion of\n",
      "foods containing carbohydrates (sugars and starches).\n",
      "Glucose from the digested food circulates in the blood\n",
      "as a ready energy source for any cells that need it.\n",
      "Insulin is a hormone or chemical produced by cells in\n",
      "the pancreas, an organ located behind the stomach.\n",
      "Insulin bonds to a receptor site on the outside of cell and\n",
      "acts like a key to open a doorway into the cell through\n",
      "which glucose can enter. Some of the glucose can be\n",
      "converted to concentrated energy sources like glycogen\n",
      "or fatty acids and saved for later use. When there is not\n",
      "enough insulin produced or when the doorway no longer\n",
      "recognizes the insulin key, glucose stays in the blood\n",
      "rather entering the cells.\n",
      "The body will attempt to dilute the high level of\n",
      "glucose in the blood, a condition called hyperglycemia,\n",
      "by drawing water out of the cells and into the blood-\n",
      "stream in an effort to dilute the sugar and excrete it in\n",
      "the urine. It is not unusual for people with undiagnosed\n",
      "diabetes to be constantly thirsty, drink large quantities of\n",
      "water, and urinate frequently as their bodies try to get rid\n",
      "of the extra glucose. This creates high levels of glucose\n",

      "thus making patients extremely hungry. To provide\n",
      "energy for the starving cells, the body also tries to con-\n",
      "vert fats and proteins to glucose. The breakdown of fats\n",
      "and proteins for energy causes acid compounds called\n",
      "ketones to form in the blood. Ketones will also be\n",

      "The outside layer of skin normally forms a protec-\n",

      "causes of dermatitis in the diaper area is prolonged skin\n",

      "Some babies are more prone to diaper rash than others.\n",

      "Frequently a flat, red rash is caused by simple chaf-\n",

      "rash. This type of rash is not seen in the skin folds. It may\n",
      "be more pronounced around the edges of the diaper, at\n",
      "the waist and leg bands. The baby generally doesn’t\n",
      "appear to experience much discomfort. Sometimes the\n",
      "chemicals or detergents in the diaper are contributing\n",

      "Ignoring the condition may lead to a secondary infection\n",
      "that is more difficult to resolve.\n",
      "Friction of skin against itself can cause a rash in the\n",

      "has existed since antiquity. For example, Judaism has\n",
      "included numerous dietary restrictions for thousands\n",
      "of years. One ancient Jewish sect, the Essenes, is said\n",
      "to have developed a primitive detoxification diet\n",
      "aimed at preparing the bodies, minds, and spirits of its\n",
      "members for the coming of a “messiah” who would\n",
      "deliver them from their Roman captors. Preventative\n",
      "and therapeutic diets became quite popular during the\n",
      "late twentieth century. Books promoting the latest\n",
      "dietary plan continue to make the bestseller lists,\n",
      "although not all of the information given is considered\n",
      "authoritative.\n",
      "The idea of a healthful diet is to provide all of the\n",
      "calories and nutrients needed by the body for optimal\n",
      "performance, at the same time ensuring that neither\n",
      "nutritional deficiencies nor excesses occur. Diet plans\n",
      "that claim to accomplish those objectives are so numer-\n",
      "ous they are virtually uncountable. These diets employ a\n",
      "variety of approaches, including the following:\n",
      "• Fixed-menu: Offers little choice to the dieter. Specifies\n",
      "exactly which foods will be consumed. Easy to follow,\n",
      "but may be considered “boring” to some dieters.\n",
      "• Formula: Replaces some or all meals with a nutritional-\n",
      "ly balanced liquid formula or powder.\n",
      "• Exchange-type: Allows the dieter to choose between\n",
      "selected foods from each food group.\n",
      "• Flexible: Doesn’t concern itself with the overall diet,\n",
      "simply with one aspect such as fat or energy.\n",
      "Diets may also be classified according to the types\n",
      "of foods they allow. For example, an omnivorous diet\n",
      "consists of both animal and plant foods, whereas a lacto-\n",
      "ovo-vegetarian diet permits no animal flesh, but does\n",
      "include eggs, milk, and dairy products. A vegan diet is a\n",
      "stricter form of vegetarianism in which eggs, cheese,\n",
      "and other milk products are prohibited.\n",
      "A third way of classifying diets is according to their\n",

      "Dieters should be cautious about plans that severely\n",
      "restrict the size of food portions, or that eliminate entire\n",
      "food groups from the diet. It is highly probable that they\n",

      "without ill effects, that offers sufficient variety and bal-\n",
      "ance to provide everything needed for good health, and\n",
      "that is considerate of personal food preferences.\n",
      "Low-fat diets are not recommended for children\n",
      "under the age of two. Young children need extra fat to\n",
      "maintain their active, growing bodies. Fat intake may be\n",
      "gradually reduced between the ages of two and five, after\n",
      "which it should be limited to a maximum of 30% of total\n",

      "Causes and symptoms\n",
      "The cause of DLE is unknown. It is thought that\n",
      "DLE (like SLE) may be an autoimmune disorder.\n",
      "Autoimmune disordersare those that occur when cells\n",
      "of the immune system are misdirected against the body.\n",
      "Normally, immune cells work to recognize and help\n",
      "destroy foreign invaders like bacteria, viruses, and fungi.\n",
      "In autoimmune disorders, these cells mistakenly recog-\n",
      "nize various tissues of the body as foreign invaders, and\n",
      "attack and destroy these tissues. In SLE, the misdirected\n",
      "immune cells are antibodies. In DLE, the damaging cells\n",
      "are believed to be a type of white blood cell called a T\n",
      "lymphocyte. The injury to the skin results in inflamma-\n",
      "tion and the characteristic discoid lesions.\n",
      "In DLE, the characteristic skin lesion is circular and\n",
      "raised. The reddish rash is about 5–10 mm in diameter,\n",
      "with the center often somewhat scaly and lighter in color\n",
      "than the darker outer ring. The surface of these lesions is\n",
      "sometimes described as “warty.” There is rarely any itch-\n",
      "ing or pain associated with discoid lesions. They tend to\n",
      "appear on the face, ears, neck, scalp, chest, back, and\n",
      "arms. As DLE lesions heal, they leave thickened, scarred\n",
      "areas of skin. When the scalp is severely affected, there\n",
      "may be associated hair loss (alopecia).\n",
      "People with DLE tend to be quite sensitive to the\n",
      "sun. They are more likely to get a sunburn, and the sun\n",
      "is likely to worsen their discoid lesions.\n",
      "Diagnosis\n",
      "Diagnosis of DLE usually requires a skin biopsy. A\n",
      "small sample of a discoid lesion is removed, specially\n",
      "prepared, and examined under a microscope. Usually, the\n",
      "lesion has certain microscopic characteristics that allow it\n",
      "to be identified as a DLE lesion. Blood tests will not\n",
      "reveal the type of antibodies present in SLE, and physical\n",
      "examination usually does not reveal anything other than\n",
      "the skin lesions. If antibodies exist in the blood, or if other\n",
      "symptoms or physical signs are found, it is possible that\n",
      "the discoid lesions are a sign of SLE rather than DLE.\n",
      "Treatment\n",
      "Treatment of DLE primarily involves the use of a\n",
      "variety of skin creams. Sunscreens are used for protec-\n",
      "tion. Steroid creams can be applied to decrease inflamma-\n",
      "tion. Occasionally, small amounts of a steroid preparation\n",
      "will be injected with a needle into a specific lesion.\n",
      "Because of their long list of side effects, steroid prepara-\n",
      "tions taken by mouth are avoided. Sometimes, short-term\n",
      "treatment with oral steroids will be used for particularly\n",
      "severe DLE outbreaks. Medications used to treat the\n",
      "infectious disease malaria are often used to treat DLE.\n",
      "Alternative treatment\n",
      "Alternative treatments for DLE include eating a\n",
      "healthy diet, low in red meat and dairy products and high\n",
      "in fish containing omega-3 fatty acids. These types of\n",
      "fish include mackerel, sardines, and salmon. Following a\n",
      "healthy diet is thought to decrease inflammation. Dietary\n",
      "supplements believed to be helpful include vitamins B,\n",
      "C, E, and selenium. Vitamin A is also recommended to\n",
      "improve DLE lesions. Constitutional homeopathic treat-\n",
      "ment can help heal DLE as well as help prevent it devel-\n",
      "oping into SLE.\n",
      "Prognosis\n",
      "For the most part, the prognosis for people with\n",
      "DLE is excellent. While the lesions may be cosmetically\n",
      "unsightly, they are not life threatening and usually do not\n",
      "cause a patient to change his or her lifestyle. Only about\n",
      "10% of patients with DLE will go on to develop SLE.\n",

      "Diverticula tend to occur most frequently in the\n",

      "They occur with decreasing frequency as one examines\n",
      "further back toward the beginning of the large intes-\n",

      "with age, so that by the age of 50, about 20–50% of all\n",
      "people will have some diverticula. By the age of 90,\n",

      "cm in diameter. Larger diverticula, termed giant diver-\n",
      "ticula, are quite infrequent, but may measure as large\n",
      "as 15 cm in diameter.\n",
      "Causes and symptoms\n",
      "Diverticula are believed to be caused by overly\n",
      "forceful contractions of the muscular wall of the large\n",
      "intestine. As areas of this wall spasm, they become weak-\n",
      "er and weaker, allowing the inner lining to bulge through.\n",
      "The anatomically weakest areas of the intestinal wall\n",
      "occur next to blood vessels which course through the\n",
      "wall, so diverticula commonly occur in this location.\n",
      "Diverticula are most common in the developed\n",
      "countries of the West (North America, Great Britain,\n",
      "northern and western Europe). This is thought to be due\n",
      "to the diet of these countries, which tends to be quite low\n",
      "in fiber. A diet low in fiber results in the production of\n",
      "smaller volumes of stool. In order to move this smaller\n",
      "stool along the colon and out of the rectum, the colon\n",
      "must narrow itself significantly, and does so by contract-\n",
      "ing down forcefully. This causes an increase in pressure,\n",
      "which, over time, weakens the muscular wall of the intes-\n",
      "tine and allows diverticular pockets to develop.\n",
      "The origin of giant diverticula development is not\n",
      "completely understood, although one theory involves gas\n",

      "condition (such as irritable bowel syndrome ) might be\n",
      "responsible. A complication of diverticulosis occurs\n",

      "As a disorder, dizziness is classified into three cate-\n",
      "gories—vertigo, syncope, and nonsyncope nonvertigo.\n",
      "Each category has a characteristic set of symptoms, all\n",
      "related to the sense of balance. In general, syncope is\n",
      "defined by a brief loss of consciousness (fainting) or by\n",
      "dimmed vision and feeling uncoordinated, confused, and\n",
      "lightheaded. Many people experience a sensation like\n",
      "syncope when they stand up too fast. Vertigo is the feeling\n",
      "that either the individual or the surroundings are spinning.\n",
      "This sensation is like being on a spinning amusement\n",
      "park ride. Individuals with nonsyncope nonvertigo dizzi-\n",
      "ness feel as though they cannot keep their balance. This\n",
      "feeling may become worse with movement.\n",
      "Description\n",
      "The brain coordinates information from the eyes, the\n",
      "inner ear, and the body’s senses to maintain balance. If\n",
      "any of these information sources is disrupted, the brain\n",
      "may not be able to compensate. For example, people\n",
      "sometimes experience motion sickness because the\n",
      "information from their body tells the brain that they are\n",
      "sitting still, but information from the eyes indicates that\n",
      "they are moving. The messages don’t correspond and\n",
      "dizziness results.\n",
      "Vision and the body’s senses are the most important\n",
      "systems for maintaining balance, but problems in the\n",
      "inner ear are the most frequent cause of dizziness. The\n",
      "inner ear, also called the vestibular system, contains fluid\n",
      "that helps fine tune the information the brain receives\n",
      "from the eyes and the body. When fluid volume or pres-\n",
      "sure in one inner ear changes, information about balance\n",
      "is altered. The discrepancy gives conflicting messages to\n",
      "the brain about balance and induces dizziness.\n",
      "Certain medical conditions can cause dizziness,\n",
      "because they affect the systems that maintain balance.\n",
      "For example, the inner ear is very sensitive to changes in\n",
      "blood flow. Because medical conditions such as high\n",
      "blood pressure or low blood sugar can affect blood flow,\n",
      "these conditions are frequently accompanied by dizzi-\n",

      "of dizziness. Other causes are head injury, ear infection,\n",
      "allergies, and nervous system disorders.\n",
      "Dizziness often disappears without treatment or with\n",

      "tic procedure that changes sound waves into an image\n",
      "that can be viewed on a monitor.\n",
      "Purpose\n",
      "Doppler ultrasonography can detect the direction,\n",
      "velocity, and turbulence of blood flow. It is frequently\n",
      "used to detect problems with heart valves or to measure\n",
      "blood flow through the arteries. Specifically, it is useful\n",
      "in the work up of stroke patients, in assessing blood flow\n",
      "in the abdomen or legs, and in viewing the heart to moni-\n",
      "tor carotid artery diseases.\n",
      "Precautions\n",
      "The test is widely used because it is noninvasive,\n",
      "uses no x rays, and gives excellent images. It is harmless,\n",
      "painless, and widely available.\n",
      "Description\n",
      "Doppler ultrasonography makes use of two different\n",
      "principles. The ultrasound principle is this: when a high-\n",
      "frequency sound is produced and aimed at a target, it will\n",
      "be reflected by its target and the reflected sound can be\n",
      "detected back at its origin. In addition, it is known that\n",
      "certain crystals (called piezoelectric crystals) produce an\n",
      "electrical pulse when vibrated by a returning sound.\n",
      "The Doppler principle is simply that sound pitch\n",
      "increases as the source moves toward the listener and\n",
      "decreases as it moves away.\n",
      "Medical science utilizes these two principles in the\n",
      "following way. A transducer (sometimes called a probe)\n",
      "containing piezoelectric crystals sends a series of short\n",
      "sound pulses into the body and pauses between each\n",
      "pulse to listen for the returning sounds. The machine\n",
      "then determines the direction and depth of each returning\n",
      "sound and coverts this into a point of light on a television\n",
      "monitor. Thousands of these pulses are computed and\n",
      "displayed every second to produce an image of the organ\n",
      "being studied. The image allows the doctor to see the\n",
      "organ functioning in real time.\n",
      "The newest addition to this test is the addition of\n",
      "color. Adding color to the image shows the direction and\n",
      "rate of blood flow more clearly.\n",
      "During a Doppler ultrasonography procedure the\n",
      "technician will apply a gel to the skin, then place the\n",

      "Preparation\n",

      "Drug therapy monitoring, also known as Therapeutic\n",
      "Drug Monitoring (TDM), is a means of monitoring drug\n",
      "levels in the blood.\n",
      "Purpose\n",
      "TDM is employed to measure blood drug levels so\n",
      "that the most effective dosage can be determined, with\n",
      "toxicity prevented. TDM is also utilized to identify non-\n",

      "son, either cannot or will not comply with drug dosages\n",
      "as prescribed by the physician).\n",
      "Precautions\n",
      "Because so many different factors influence blood\n",
      "drug levels, the following points should be taken into\n",
      "consideration during TDM: the age and weight of the\n",
      "patient; the route of administration of the drug; the drug’s\n",
      "absorption rate, excretion rate, delivery rate, and dosage;\n",
      "other medications the patient is taking; other diseases the\n",

      "Description\n",
      "TDM is a practical tool that can help the physician\n",
      "provide effective and safe drug therapy in patients who\n",
      "need medication. Monitoring can be used to confirm a\n",
      "blood drug concentration level that is above or below the\n",
      "therapeutic range, or if the desired therapeutic effect of\n",
      "the drug is not as expected. If this is the case, and\n",
      "dosages beyond normal then have to be prescribed, TDM\n",
      "can minimize the time that elapses.\n",
      "TDM is important for patients who have other dis-\n",

      "cines that may affect drug levels by interacting with the\n",

      "response to an antibiotic reflects bacterial resistance, or\n",
      "is the result of failure to reach the proper therapeutic\n",
      "range of antibiotic concentration in the blood. In cases of\n",
      "life-threatening infections, timing of effective antibiotic\n",
      "therapy is critical to success. It is equally crucial to avoid\n",
      "toxicity in a seriously ill patient. Therefore, if toxic\n",
      "symptoms appear with standard dosages, TDM can be\n",
      "used to determine changes in dosing.\n",
      "Drawn blood, used for TDM, demonstrates a drug\n",
      "action in the body at any specific time, whereas drug lev-\n",
      "els examined from urine samples reflect the presence of a\n",
      "drug over many days (depending on the rate of excre-\n",
      "tion). Therefore, blood testing is the procedure of choice\n",
      "when definite data are required. However, for adequate\n",
      "absorption and therapeutic levels to be accurate, it is\n",
      "important to allow for sufficient time to pass between the\n",
      "administration of the medication and the collection of the\n",
      "blood sample.\n",
      "Blood specimens for drug monitoring can be taken\n",
      "at two different times: during the drug’s highest thera-\n",
      "peutic concentration (“peak” level), or its lowest\n",
      "(“trough” level). Occasionally called residual levels,\n",
      "trough levels show sufficient therapeutic levels; whereas\n",
      "peak levels show poisoning (toxicity). Peak and trough\n",
      "levels should fall within the therapeutic range.\n",
      "Preparation\n",
      "In preparing for this test, the following guidelines\n",
      "should be observed:\n",
      "• Depending on the drug to be tested, the physician\n",
      "should decide if the patient is to be fasting (nothing\n",
      "to eat or drink for a specified period of hours) before\n",
      "the test.\n",
      "• For patients suspected of symptoms of drug toxicity,\n",
      "the best time to draw the blood specimen is when the\n",
      "symptoms are occurring.\n",
      "• If there is a question as to whether an adequate dose of\n",
      "the drug is being achieved, it is best to obtain trough\n",
      "(lowest therapeutic concentration) levels.\n",
      "• Peak (highest concentration) levels are usually obtained\n",
      "one to two hours after oral intake, approximately one\n",
      "hour after intramuscular (IM) administration (a shot in\n",
      "the muscle), and approximately 30 minutes after intra-\n",

      "Definition\n",
      "Echocardiography is a diagnostic test that uses ultra-\n",
      "sound waves to create an image of the heart muscle.\n",
      "Ultrasound waves that rebound or echo off the heart can\n",
      "show the size, shape, and movement of the heart’s valves\n",
      "and chambers as well as the flow of blood through the\n",

      "as poorly functioning heart valves or damage to the heart\n",
      "tissue from a past heart attack.\n",
      "Purpose\n",
      "Echocardiography is used to diagnose certain cardio-\n",
      "vascular diseases. In fact, it is one of the most widely used\n",
      "diagnostic tests for heart disease. It can provide a wealth\n",
      "of helpful information, including the size and shape of the\n",
      "heart, its pumping strength, and the location and extent of\n",
      "any damage to its tissues. It is especially useful for assess-\n",
      "ing diseases of the heart valves. It not only allows doctors\n",
      "to evaluate the heart valves, but it can detect abnormalities\n",
      "in the pattern of blood flow, such as the backward flow of\n",
      "blood through partly closed heart valves, known as regur-\n",
      "gitation. By assessing the motion of the heart wall,\n",

      "ease. Echocardiography can also help detect hypertrophic\n",
      "cardiomyopathy, in which the walls of the heart thicken\n",
      "in an attempt to compensate for heart muscle weakness.\n",
      "The biggest advantage to echocardiography is that it is\n",
      "noninvasive (doesn’t involve breaking the skin or entering\n",
      "body cavities) and has no known risks or side effects.\n",
      "Precautions\n",
      "Echocardiography is an extremely safe procedure\n",
      "and no special precautions are required.\n",
      "Description\n",
      "Echocardiography creates an image of the heart\n",
      "using ultra-high-frequency sound waves—sound waves\n",
      "that are too high in frequency to be heard by the human\n",
      "ear. The technique is very similar to ultrasound scanning\n",
      "commonly used to visualize the fetus during pregnancy.\n",
      "An echocardiography examination generally lasts\n",
      "between 15–30 minutes. The patient lies bare-chested on\n",
      "an examination table. A special gel is spread over the\n",
      "chest to help the transducer make good contact and slide\n",
      "smoothly over the skin. The transducer, a small hand-held\n",
      "device at the end of a flexible cable, is placed against the\n",
      "chest. Essentially a modified microphone, the transducer\n",
      "directs ultrasound waves into the chest. Some of the\n",
      "waves get echoed (or reflected) back to the transducer.\n",
      "Since different tissues and blood all reflect ultrasound\n",
      "waves differently, these sound waves can be translated\n",
      "into a meaningful image of the heart, which can be dis-\n",
      "played on a monitor or recorded on paper or tape. The\n",

      "II. The major symptoms involved in EDS classical type\n",
      "are the skin and joints. The skin has a smooth, velvety\n",
      "texture and bruises easily. Affected individuals typically\n",
      "have extensive scaring, particularly at the knees, elbows,\n",
      "forehead, and chin. The joints are hyperextensible, giving\n",

      "could be cured. Some doctors were already using a vari-\n",
      "ety of chemicals to produce seizures, but many of their\n",
      "patients died or suffered severe injuries because the\n",

      "Many assumed the procedure would be painful, others\n",
      "thought it was a form of electrocution, and still others\n",
      "believed it would cause brain damage. Unfortunately,\n",
      "unfavorable publicity in newspapers, magazines, and\n",
      "movies added to these fears.\n",
      "Indeed, in those early years, patients and families\n",
      "were rarely educated by doctors and nurses regarding this\n",
      "or other forms of psychiatric treatment. In addition, no\n",
      "anesthesia or muscle relaxants were used. As a result,\n",
      "patients had violent seizures, and even though they did\n",
      "not remember them, the procedure itself was frightening.\n",
      "The way these treatments are given today is very dif-\n",

      "Definition\n",
      "Electrolytes are positively and negatively charged\n",
      "molecules, called ions, that are found within cells,\n",
      "between cells, in the bloodstream, and in other fluids\n",
      "throughout the body. Electrolytes with a positive charge\n",
      "include sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium; the\n",
      "negative ions are chloride, bicarbonate, and phosphate.\n",
      "The concentrations of these ions in the bloodstream\n",
      "remain fairly constant throughout the day in a healthy\n",
      "person. Changes in the concentration of one or more of\n",
      "these ions can occur during various acute and chronic\n",
      "disease states and can lead to serious consequences.\n",
      "Purpose\n",
      "Tests that measure the concentration of electrolytes\n",
      "are useful in the emergency room and to obtain clues for\n",

      "Precautions\n",
      "Electrolyte tests are performed from routine blood\n",
      "tests. The techniques are simple, automated, and fairly\n",
      "uniform throughout the United States. During the prepa-\n",
      "ration of blood plasma or serum, health workers must\n",
      "take care not to break the red blood cells, especially\n",
      "when testing for serum potassium. Because the concen-\n",
      "tration of potassium within red blood cells is much high-\n",
      "er than in the surrounding plasma or serum, broken cells\n",
      "would cause falsely elevated potassium levels.\n",
      "Description\n",
      "Electrolyte tests are typically conducted on blood\n",
      "plasma or serum, urine, and diarrheal fluids. Electrolytes\n",
      "can be classified in at least five different ways. One way\n",
      "is that some electrolytes tend to exist mostly inside cells,\n",
      "or are intracellular, while others tend to be outside cells,\n",
      "or are extracellular. Potassium, phosphate, and magne-\n",
      "sium occur at much greater levels inside the cell than\n",
      "outside, while sodium and chloride occur at much greater\n",
      "levels extracellularly. A second classification distinguish-\n",
      "es those electrolytes that participate directly in the trans-\n",
      "mission of nerve impulses and those that do not. Sodium,\n",
      "potassium, and calcium are the important electrolytes\n",
      "involved in nerve impulses, and disorders affecting them\n",
      "are most closely associated with neurological disorders.\n",
      "A third classification focuses on electrolytes that are able\n",
      "to form a tight union, or complex, with one another. Cal-\n",
      "cium and phosphate have the greatest tendency to form\n",
      "complexes with each other. Disorders that cause an\n",
      "increase in either plasma calcium or phosphate can result\n",
      "in the deposit of calcium-phosphate crystals in the soft\n",
      "tissues of the body. A fourth classification concerns those\n",
      "electrolytes that influence the acidity or alkalinity of the\n",
      "bloodstream, also known as the pH. The pH of the blood-\n",
      "stream is normally in the range of 7.35–7.45. A decrease\n",
      "below this range is called acidosis, while a pH above this\n",
      "range is called alkalosis. The electrolytes most closely\n",
      "associated with the pH of the bloodstream are bicarbon-\n",
      "ate, chloride, and phosphate.\n",
      "Preparation\n",
      "All electrolyte tests can be performed on plasma or\n",
      "serum. Plasma is prepared by withdrawing a blood sam-\n",
      "ple and placing it in a test tube containing a chemical that\n",
      "prevents blood from clotting (an anticoagulant). Serum is\n",
      "prepared by withdrawing a blood sample, placing it in a\n",
      "test tube, and allowing it to clot. The blood spontaneously\n",
      "clots within a minute of withdrawing the blood from a\n",
      "vein. The serum or plasma is then rapidly spun with a\n",
      "centrifuge in order to remove the blood cells or clot.\n",
      "Normal results\n",
      "Electrolyte concentrations are similar whether mea-\n",

      "A cardiologist may recommend an EP study when\n",
      "the standard EKG, Holter monitor, event recorder, stress\n",
      "test, echocardiogram, or angiogram cannot provide\n",
      "enough information to evaluate an abnormal heart\n",

      "An EP study also may be beneficial in diagnosing a\n",
      "suspected arrhythmia in a patient who shows symptoms\n",
      "of an arrhythmia but in whom it could not be detected\n",
      "from other tests.\n",
      "The purpose and great value of an EP study is that it\n",
      "offers more detailed information to the doctor about the\n",
      "electrical activity in the heart than the aforementioned\n",
      "noninvasive tests because electrodes are placed directly\n",
      "onheart tissue. This allows the electrophysiologist to\n",
      "determine the specific location of an arrhythmia and,\n",
      "oftentimes, correct it during the same procedure. This\n",

      "Description\n",
      "The rhythmic pumping action of the heart, which is\n",
      "essentially a muscle, is the result of electrical impulses\n",
      "traveling throughout the walls of the four heart cham-\n",
      "bers. These impulses originate in the sinoatrial (SA)\n",
      "node, which are specialized cells situated in the top right\n",
      "chamber of the heart: the right atrium. Normally, the SA\n",
      "node, acting like a spark plug, spontaneously generates\n",
      "the impulses, which travel through specific pathways\n",
      "throughout the atria to the atrioventricular (A V) node.\n",
      "The A V node is a relay station, sending the impulses to\n",
      "more specialized muscle fibers throughout the bottom\n",
      "chambers of the heart: the ventricles. If these pathways\n",
      "become damaged or blocked or if extra (abnormal) path-\n",
      "ways exist, the heart’s rhythm may be altered (perhaps\n",
      "too slow, too fast, or irregular), which can seriously\n",
      "affect the heart’s pumping ability.\n",
      "The patient is transported to the x-ray table in the EP\n",
      "lab and connected to various monitors. Sterile sheets are\n",
      "placed over him or her. A minimum of two catheters are\n",
      "inserted into the right femoral (thigh) vein in the groin\n",
      "area. Depending on the type of arrhythmia, the number\n",
      "of catheters used in an EP test and their route to the heart\n",
      "may vary. For certain tachycardias, two more catheters\n",

      "With the help of fluoroscopy (x rays on a television\n",

      "There are a few different causes of elephantiasis, but\n",
      "the agents responsible for most of the elephantiasis in the\n",
      "world are filarial worms: white, slender round worms\n",
      "found in most tropical and subtropical places. They are\n",
      "transmitted by particular kinds (species) of mosquitoes,\n",
      "that is, bloodsucking insects. Infection with these worms\n",
      "is called “lymphatic filariasis” and over a long period of\n",
      "time can cause elephantiasis.\n",
      "Lymphatic filariasis is a disease of underdeveloped\n",
      "regions found in South America, Central Africa, Asia, the\n",

      "Description\n",
      "Emboli have moved from the place where they were\n",
      "formed through the bloodstream to another part of the\n",

      "but are occasionally comprised of air, fat, or tumor tis-\n",
      "sue. Embolic events can be multiple and small, or single\n",
      "and massive. They can be life-threatening and require\n",

      "treated effectively within hours. Intestines and kidneys\n",

      "Pulmonary embolism\n",
      "In a pulmonary embolism, a common illness, blood\n",
      "flow is blocked at a pulmonary artery. When emboli block\n",
      "the main pulmonary artery, and in cases where there are\n",

      "Definition\n",
      "Emphysema is a chronic respiratory disease where\n",
      "there is over-inflation of the air sacs (alveoli) in the\n",
      "lungs, causing a decrease in lung function, and often,\n",
      "breathlessness.\n",
      "Description\n",
      "Emphysema is the most common cause of death\n",
      "from respiratory disease in the United States, and is the\n",
      "fourth most common cause of death overall. There are\n",
      "1.8 million Americans with the disease, which ranks fif-\n",
      "teenth among chronic conditions that cause limitations of\n",
      "activity. The disease is usually caused by smoking, but a\n",
      "small number of cases are caused by an inherited defect.\n",
      "Normally functioning lungs are elastic, efficiently\n",
      "expanding and recoiling as air passes freely through the\n",
      "bronchus to the alveoli, where oxygen is moved into the\n",
      "blood and carbon dioxide is filtered out. When a person\n",
      "inhales cigarette smoke or certain other irritants, his or\n",
      "her immune system responds by releasing substances\n",
      "that are meant to defend the lungs against the smoke.\n",
      "These substances can also attack the cells of the lungs,\n",
      "but the body normally inhibits such action with the\n",
      "release of other substances. In smokers and those with\n",
      "the inherited defect, however, no such prevention occurs\n",
      "and the lung tissue is damaged in such a way that it loses\n",
      "its elasticity. The small passageways (bronchioles) lead-\n",
      "ing to the alveoli collapse, trapping air within the alveoli.\n",
      "The alveoli, unable to recoil efficiently and move the air\n",
      "out, over expand and rupture. As the disease progresses,\n",
      "coughing and shortness of breath occur. In the later\n",
      "stages, the lungs cannot supply enough oxygen to the\n",
      "blood. Emphysema often occurs with other respiratory\n",
      "diseases, particularly chronic bronchitis. These two dis-\n",
      "eases are often referred to as one disorder called chronic\n",
      "obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n",
      "Emphysema is most common among people aged 50\n",
      "and older. Those with inherited emphysema may experience\n",
      "the onset as early as their thirties or fourties Men are more\n",
      "likely than women to develop emphysema, but female cases\n",
      "are increasing as the number of female smokers rises.\n",
      "Causes and symptoms\n",
      "Heavy cigarette smoking causes about 80–90% of\n",
      "all emphysema cases. However a few cases are the result\n",
      "of an inherited deficiency of a substance called alpha-1-\n",
      "antitrypsin (AAT). The number of Americans with this\n",
      "deficiency is relatively small, probably no greater than\n",
      "70,000. Pipe, cigar, and marijuana smoking can also\n",
      "damage the lungs. While a person may be less likely to\n",
      "inhale cigar and pipe smoke, these types of smoke can\n",
      "also impair lung function. Marijuana smoke may be even\n",
      "more damaging because it is inhaled deeply and held in\n",
      "by the smoker.\n",
      "The symptoms of emphysema develop gradually\n",
      "over many years. It is a common occurrence for many\n",

      "More than 95% of uterine cancers arise in the\n",
      "endometrium. The most common type of uterine cancer\n",
      "is adenocarcinoma. It arises from an abnormal multipli-\n",

      "Although the exact cause of endometrial cancer is\n",
      "unknown, it is clear that high levels of estrogen, when\n",

      "growth of the endometrium. Factors that increase a\n",
      "woman’s risk of developing endometrial cancer are:\n",
      "• Age. The risk is considerably higher in women who are\n",
      "over the age of 50 and have gone through menopause.\n",
      "• Obesity. Being overweight is a very strong risk factor\n",
      "for this cancer. Fatty tissue can change other normal\n",
      "body chemicals into estrogen, which can promote\n",
      "endometrial cancer.\n",
      "• Estrogen replacement therapy. Women receiving estro-\n",
      "gen supplements after menopause have a 12 times high-\n",
      "er risk of getting endometrial cancer if progesterone is\n",
      "not taken simultaneously.\n",
      "• Diabetes. Diabetics have twice the risk of getting this\n",
      "cancer as nondiabetic women. It is not clear if this risk\n",
      "is due to the fact that many diabetics are also obese and\n",
      "hypertensive. One 1998 study found that women who\n",
      "were obese and diabetic were three times more likely to\n",
      "develop endometrial cancer than women who were\n",
      "obese but nondiabetic. This study also found that\n",
      "nonobese diabetics were not at risk of developing\n",
      "endometrial cancer.\n",
      "• Hypertension . High blood pressure (or hypertension)\n",
      "is also considered a risk factor for uterine cancer.\n",
      "• Irregular menstrual periods. During the menstrual\n",
      "cycle, there is interaction between the hormones estro-\n",
      "gen and progesterone. Women who do not ovulate regu-\n",
      "larly are exposed to high estrogen levels for longer peri-\n",
      "ods of time. If a woman does not ovulate regularly, this\n",
      "delicate balance is upset and may increase her chances\n",
      "of getting uterine cancer.\n",
      "• Early first menstruation or late menopause. Having\n",
      "the first period at a young age (the mean age of\n",
      "menses is 12.16 years in African American girls and\n",
      "12.88 years in caucasian girls) or going through\n",
      "menopause at a late age (over age 51) seem to put\n",
      "women at a slightly higher risk for developing\n",
      "endometrial cancer.\n",
      "• Tamoxifen. This drug, which is used to treat or prevent\n",
      "breast cancer, increases a woman’s chance of develop-\n",

      "more advanced endometrial cancer with an associated\n",

      "for treating breast cancer and for preventing the cancer\n",
      "from spreading far outweighs the small risk of getting\n",

      "Definition\n",
      "Endometriosis is a condition in which bits of the tis-\n",
      "sue similar to the lining of the uterus (endometrium) grow\n",
      "in other parts of the body. Like the uterine lining, this tis-\n",
      "sue builds up and sheds in response to monthly hormonal\n",
      "cycles. However, there is no natural outlet for the blood\n",
      "discarded from these implants. Instead, it falls onto sur-\n",
      "rounding organs, causing swelling and inflammation. This\n",
      "repeated irritation leads to the development of scar tissue\n",
      "and adhesions in the area of the endometrial implants.\n",
      "Description\n",
      "Endometriosis is estimated to affect 7% of women of\n",
      "childbearing age in the United States. It most commonly\n",
      "strikes between the ages of 25 and 40. Endometriosis can\n",
      "also appear in the teen years, but never before the start of\n",
      "menstruation. It is seldom seen in postmenopausal\n",
      "women.\n",
      "Endometriosis was once called the “career woman’s\n",
      "disease” because it was thought to be a product of\n",
      "delayed childbearing. The statistics defy such a narrow\n",
      "generalization; however,pregnancy may slow the\n",
      "progress of the condition. A more important predictor of\n",
      "a woman’s risk is if her female relatives have endome-\n",
      "triosis. Another influencing factor is the length of a\n",
      "woman’s menstrual cycle. Women whose periods last\n",
      "longer than a week with an interval of less than 27 days\n",
      "between them seem to be more prone to the condition.\n",
      "Endometrial implants are most often found on the\n",
      "pelvic organs—the ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes, and in\n",
      "the cavity behind the uterus. Occasionally, this tissue\n",
      "grows in such distant parts of the body as the lungs, arms,\n",
      "and kidneys. Newly formed implants appear as small\n",
      "bumps on the surfaces of the organs and supporting liga-\n",
      "ments and are sometimes said to look like “powder burns.”\n",
      "Ovarian cystsmay form around endometrial tissue\n",
      "(endometriomas) and may range from pea to grapefruit\n",
      "size. Endometriosis is a progressive condition that usually\n",
      "advances slowly, over the course of many years. Doctors\n",
      "rank cases from minimal to severe based on factors such as\n",
      "the number and size of the endometrial implants, their\n",
      "appearance and location, and the extent of the scar tissue\n",
      "and adhesions in the vicinity of the growths.\n",
      "Causes and symptoms\n",
      "Although the exact cause of endometriosis is\n",
      "unknown, a number of theories have been put forward.\n",
      "Some of the more popular ones are:\n",
      "• Implantation theory. Originally proposed in the 1920s,\n",
      "this theory states that a reversal in the direction of men-\n",
      "strual flow sends discarded endometrial cells into the\n",
      "body cavity where they attach to internal organs and\n",
      "seed endometrial implants. There is considerable evi-\n",
      "dence to support this explanation. Reversed menstrual\n",

      "Endometriosis\n",
      "{'source': 'data\\\\The_GALE_ENCYCLOPEDIA_of_MEDICINE_SECOND.pdf', 'page': 578}\n",
      "flow occurs in 70–90% of women and is thought to be\n",
      "more common in women with endometriosis. However,\n",
      "many women with reversed menstrual flow do not\n",
      "develop endometriosis.\n",
      "• Vascular-lymphatic theory. This theory suggests that\n",
      "the lymph system or blood vessels (vascular system) is\n",
      "the vehicle for the distribution of endometrial cells out\n",
      "of the uterus.\n",
      "• Coelomic metaplasia theory. According to this hypothe-\n",
      "sis, remnants of tissue left over from prenatal develop-\n",
      "ment of the woman’s reproductive tract transforms into\n",
      "endometrial cells throughout the body.\n",
      "• Induction theory. This explanation postulates that an\n",
      "unidentified substance found in the body forces cells\n",
      "from the lining of the body cavity to change into\n",
      "endometrial cells.\n",
      "In addition to these theories, the following factors are\n",
      "thought to influence the development of endometriosis:\n",
      "• Heredity. A woman’s chance of developing endometrio-\n",
      "sis is seven times greater if her mother or sisters have\n",
      "the disease.\n",
      "• Immune system function. Women with endometriosis\n",
      "may have lower functioning immune systems that have\n",
      "trouble eliminating stray endometrial cells. This would\n",
      "explain why a high percentage of women experience\n",
      "reversed menstrual flow while relatively few develop\n",
      "endometriosis.\n",
      "• Dioxin exposure. Some research suggests a link\n",
      "between the exposure to dioxin (TCCD), a toxic chemi-\n",
      "cal found in weed killers, and the development of\n",
      "endometriosis.\n",
      "While many women with endometriosis suffer debil-\n",
      "itating symptoms, others have the disease without know-\n",
      "ing it. Paradoxically, there does not seem to be any rela-\n",
      "tion between the severity of the symptoms and the extent\n",
      "of the disease. The most common symptoms are:\n",
      "• Menstrual pain. Pain in the lower abdomen that begins\n",
      "a day or two before the menstrual period starts and con-\n",
      "tinues through to the end is typical of endometriosis.\n",
      "Some women also report lower back aches and pain\n",
      "during urination and bowel movement, especially dur-\n",
      "ing their periods.\n",
      "• Painful sexual intercourse. Pressure on the vagina and\n",
      "cervix causes severe pain for some women.\n",
      "• Abnormal bleeding. Heavy menstrual periods, irregular\n",
      "bleeding, and spotting are common features of\n",
      "endometriosis.\n",
      "• Infertility . There is a strong association between\n",
      "endometriosis and infertility, although the reasons for\n",
      "this have not been fully explained. It is thought that\n",
      "the build up of scar tissue and adhesions blocks the\n",
      "fallopian tubes and prevents the ovaries from releasing\n",
      "eggs. Endometriosis may also affect fertility by caus-\n",
      "ing hormonal irregularities and a higher rate of early\n",
      "miscarriage.\n",
      "Diagnosis\n",
      "If a doctor suspects endometriosis, the first step will\n",
      "be to perform a pelvic exam to try to feel if implants are\n",
      "present. Very often there is no strong evidence of\n",
      "endometriosis from a physical exam. The only way to\n",
      "make a definitive diagnosis is through minor surgery\n",
      "called a laparoscopy. A laparoscope, a slender scope with\n",
      "a light on the end, is inserted into the woman’s abdomen\n",
      "through a small incision near her belly button. This allows\n",
      "the doctor to examine the internal organs for endometriotic\n",
      "growths. Often, a sample of tissue is taken for later exami-\n",
      "nation in the laboratory. Endometriosis is sometimes dis-\n",
      "covered when a woman has abdominal surgery for another\n",
      "reason such as tubal ligationor hysterectomy.\n",
      "Various imaging techniques such as ultrasound,\n",
      "computed tomography scan (CT scan), or magnetic res-\n",
      "onance imaging (MRI) can offer additional information\n",
      "but aren’t useful in making the initial diagnosis. A blood\n",

      "CA125. Testing for this substance before and after treat-\n",

      "enteroviruses are responsible for over 90% of cases of\n",
      "aseptic meningitis, and most often hits children and\n",

      "around the heart (pericardium). Infants and young\n",
      "adults are the most susceptible, and for some reason,\n",
      "over two-thirds of cases occur in males. The disease\n",
      "usually begins as an upper respiratory tract infection\n",
      "with cough,shortness of breath, and fever. Chest pain,\n",

      "A patient with epiglottitis typically experiences a\n",
      "sudden fever, and begins having severe throat and neck\n",
      "pain. Because the swollen epiglottis interferes signifi-\n",

      "harsh, high-pitched sound referred to as stridor. Because\n",

      "airway obstruction is very likely to be epiglottitis. If\n",
      "epiglottitis is suspected, no efforts should be made to\n",
      "look at the throat, or to swab the throat in order to obtain\n",
      "a culture for identification of the causative organism.\n",
      "These maneuvers may cause the larynx to go into spasm\n",

      "procedures should only be performed in a fully-equipped\n",

      "airway open.\n",
      "An instrument called a laryngoscope is often used in\n",
      "the operating room to view the epiglottis, which will\n",

      "the site is cleaned with an antiseptic liquid prior to the\n",

      "Description\n",
      "These tests are more often performed in a consulting\n",
      "laboratory than at a physician’s office or in a hospital\n",
      "laboratory. Like most antibody tests, they are performed\n",
      "on serum, the liquid part of the blood obtained after the\n",

      "antigen (EA), the viral capsid antigen (VCA), and the\n",
      "nuclear antigen (EBNA). These several antigens are dif-\n",
      "ferent proteins that are produced in the process (stages)\n",
      "of the virus’ growth.\n",
      "At the time of infection with Epstein-Barr virus,\n",

      "tially longer in about 10% of persons who have had EBV\n",
      "infection in the more remote past. The absence of anti-\n",
      "body to EA when other EBV antibodies are present\n",
      "strongly suggests that first time infection with EBV\n",
      "occurred in the past.\n",
      "Antibody to VCA is found both early and late in\n",
      "EBV infection. At the time of infection, antibody of\n",
      "both the IgM and IgG types are detectable. After four to\n",
      "six months, usually, only the IgG antibody against VCA\n",
      "can be found.\n",

      "hood increases to 44% in individuals who also smoke\n",
      "one or two packs of cigarettes a day. Smokeless tobacco\n",
      "also increases the risk for esophageal cancer.\n",
      "• Gastroesophageal reflux is a condition in which acid\n",
      "from the stomach refluxes backwards into the lower\n",
      "portion of the esophagus, sometimes causing symptoms\n",
      "of heartburn . In some cases of gastroesophageal\n",

      "gus. Patients with Barrett’s esophagus are roughly 30 to\n",
      "40 times more likely than the general population to\n",
      "develop adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.\n",
      "• A diet low in fruits, vegetables, zinc, riboflavin, and\n",
      "other vitamins can increase risk of developing to\n",
      "esophageal cancer.\n",
      "• Caustic injury to the esophagus inflicted by swallowing\n",
      "lye or other substances that damage esophageal cells can\n",

      "cancer in later life.\n",
      "• Achalasia is a condition in which the lower esophageal\n",
      "sphincter (muscle) cannot relax enough to let food pass\n",
      "into the stomach. Squamous cell esophageal cancer\n",
      "develops in about 6% of patients with achalasia.\n",

      "Symptoms\n",
      "Unfortunately, symptoms generally don’t appear\n",
      "until the tumor has grown so large that the patient cannot\n",
      "be cured. Dysphagia (trouble swallowing or a sensation\n",
      "of having food stuck in the throat or chest) is the most\n",
      "common symptom. Swallowing problems may occur\n",
      "occasionally at first, and patients often react by eating\n",
      "more slowly and chewing their food more carefully and,\n",
      "as the tumor grows, switching to soft foods or a liquid\n",
      "diet. Without treatment, the tumor will eventually pre-\n",
      "vent even liquid from passing into the stomach. A sensa-\n",
      "tion of burning or slight mid-chest pressure is a rare,\n",
      "often-disregarded symptom of esophageal cancer.\n",
      "Painful swallowing is usually a symptom of a large\n",
      "tumor obstructing the opening of the esophagus. It can\n",
      "lead to regurgitation of food, weight loss, physical wast-\n",
      "ing, and malnutrition . Anyone who has trouble swal-\n",
      "lowing, loses a significant amount of weight without\n",
      "dieting, or cannot eat solid food because it is too painful\n",
      "to swallow should see a doctor.\n",
      "Diagnosis\n",
      "A barium swallow is usually the first test performed\n",
      "on a patient whose symptoms suggest esophageal cancer.\n",
      "After the patient swallows a small amount of barium, a\n",
      "series of x rays can highlight any bumps or flat raised\n",
      "areas on the normally smooth surface of the esophageal\n",
      "wall. It can also detect large, irregular areas that narrow\n",
      "the esophagus in patients with advanced cancer, but it can-\n",

      "beyond the esophagus. A double contrast study is a barium\n",
      "swallow with air blown into the esophagus to improve the\n",
      "way the barium coats the esophageal lining. Endoscopy is\n",
      "a diagnostic procedure in which a thin lighted tube (endo-\n",
      "scope) is passed through the mouth, down the throat, and\n",
      "into the esophagus. Cells that appear abnormal are\n",

      "Definition\n",
      "The esophagus is the swallowing tube through\n",
      "which food passes on its way from the mouth to the\n",
      "stomach. The main function of this organ is to propel\n",
      "food down into the stomach. There is also a mechanism\n",
      "to prevent food from coming back up or “refluxing” from\n",
      "the stomach into the esophagus. Esophageal function\n",
      "tests are used to determine if these processes are normal\n",
      "or abnormal.\n",
      "Purpose\n",
      "The esophagus is a long, muscular tube that also has\n",
      "two muscles (or sphincters) at the top and bottom. All of\n",
      "these muscular areas must contract in an exact sequence\n",
      "for swallowing to proceed normally. There are three\n",
      "main symptoms that occur when esophageal function is\n",
      "abnormal: difficulty with swallowing (dysphagia),heart-\n",
      "burn, and chest pain.\n",
      "Doctors perform a variety of tests to evaluate these\n",
      "symptoms. Endoscopy, which is not a test of esophageal\n",
      "function, is often used to determine if the lining of the\n",
      "esophagus has any ulcers, tumors, or areas of narrowing\n",
      "(strictures). Many times, however, endoscopy only shows\n",
      "the doctor if there is injury to the esophageal lining, and\n",
      "the procedure gives no information about the cause of the\n",
      "problem.\n",
      "Therefore, in addition to endoscopy, several studies\n",
      "are available that measure esophageal function. There are\n",
      "three basic types of tests used to assess esophageal func-\n",

      "esophageal acidity, and is valuable for evaluating\n",
      "patients with heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux dis-\n",

      "• X-ray studies investigate swallowing difficulties. They\n",

      "useful when the swallowing symptoms appear to involve\n",
      "mainly the upper region of the esophagus. The most com-\n",
      "mon cause of swallowing difficulties is a previous stroke,\n",

      "and cleaned each night, and they do not correct all\n",

      "In addition, sometimes eye muscle surgery can help\n",

      "Description\n",
      "The extraocular muscles attach via tendons to the\n",
      "sclera (the white, opaque, outer protective covering of\n",
      "the eyeball) at different places just behind an imaginary\n",
      "equator circling the top, bottom, left, and right of the eye.\n",
      "The other end of each of these muscles attaches to a part\n",
      "of the orbit (the eye socket in the skull). These muscles\n",
      "enable the eyes to move up, down, to one side or the\n",
      "other, or any angle in between.\n",
      "Normally both eyes move together, receive the same\n",
      "image on corresponding locations on both retinas, and the\n",
      "brain fuses these images into one three-dimensional\n",
      "image. The exception is in strabismus which is a disorder\n",
      "where one or both eyes deviate out of alignment, most\n",
      "often outwardly (exotropia) or toward the nose\n",
      "(esotropia). The brain now receives two different images,\n",
      "and either suppresses one or the person sees double\n",
      "(diplopia). This deviation can be adjusted by weakening\n",
      "or strengthening the appropriate muscles to move the eyes\n",
      "toward the center. For example, if an eye turns upward,\n",
      "the muscle at the bottom of the eye could be strengthened.\n",
      "Rarely, eye muscle surgery is performed on people\n",
      "with nystagmus or Duane syndrome. Nystagmus is a con-\n",

      "where there is limited horizontal eye movement; it can\n",
      "sometimes be relieved by surgery to weaken an eye muscle.\n",
      "There are two methods to alter extraocular muscles.\n",
      "Traditional surgery can be used to strengthen, weaken, or\n",
      "reposition an extraocular muscle. The surgeon first\n",
      "makes an incision in the conjunctiva (the clear membrane\n",
      "covering the sclera), then puts a suture into the muscle to\n",
      "prevent it from getting lost and loosens the muscle from\n",
      "the eyeball with a surgical hook. During a resection, the\n",
      "muscle is detached from the sclera, a piece of muscle is\n",
      "removed so the muscle is now shorter, and the muscle is\n",
      "reattached to the same place. This strengths the muscle.\n",
      "In a recession, the muscle is made weaker by reposition-\n",
      "ing it. More than one extraocular eye muscle might be\n",
      "operated on at the same time.\n",
      "Another way of weakening eye muscles, using botu-\n",
      "linum toxin injected into the muscle, was introduced in\n",
      "the early 1980s. Although the botulinum toxin wears off,\n",
      "the realignment may be permanent, depending upon\n",
      "whether neurological connections for binocular vision\n",
      "were established during the time the toxin was active.\n",

      "Face lift\n",
      "Definition\n",
      "Face lift surgery is a cosmetic procedure that involves\n",
      "redirecting some of the skin and muscle tissue of the face\n",
      "and neck to counter signs of aging produced by gravity.\n",
      "Purpose\n",
      "The purpose of face lift surgery, also known as\n",
      "facialplasty, rhytidoplasty, or cervicofacial rhytidectomy,\n",
      "is to improve the appearance of the face by repositioning\n",
      "the skin and tightening some of the underlying muscle\n",
      "and tissue. The procedure is designed to counter sagging\n",
      "and looseness in skin and muscle tissue caused by gravi-\n",
      "ty as the patient ages. Face lift surgery will not erase all\n",
      "facial wrinkles, as the term rhytidectomy (which literally\n",
      "means “surgical removal of wrinkles”) might imply.\n",
      "Wrinkles around the mouth and eyes, for example, may\n",
      "benefit little from face lift surgery. Other procedures,\n",
      "such as blepharoplasty, chemical peel, or dermabrasion,\n",
      "also may be necessary.\n",
      "Precautions\n",
      "Patients with other medical conditions should consult\n",
      "with their primary physician before undergoing face lift\n",
      "surgery. Lung problems, heart disease, and certain other\n",
      "conditions can lead to a higher risk of complications.\n",
      "Patients who take medications that can alter the way their\n",
      "blood clots (including female hormones,aspirin, and\n",
      "some non-aspirin pain relievers) should stop these med-\n",
      "ications prior to surgery to lower the risk that a hematoma\n",
      "will form. A hematoma, a pocket of blood below the skin,\n",
      "is the most frequent complication of face lift surgery.\n",
      "Description\n",
      "Face lift surgery can be performed on an outpatient\n",
      "basis with local anesthetics. Patients typically also\n",
      "receive “twilight anesthesia,” an intravenous sedative that\n",
      "helps to lower their awareness of the procedure being\n",
      "performed.\n",
      "There are a number of variations of face lift surgery.\n",
      "Which one is used will depend on the patient’s facial\n",
      "structure, how much correction is needed, and the prefer-\n",
      "ences of the surgeon performing the procedure. In a typi-\n",
      "cal face lift surgery, the surgeon begins by making an inci-\n",
      "sion within the hairline just above the ear. The incision\n",
      "continues down along the front edge of the ear, around the\n",
      "earlobe, and then up and behind the ear extending back\n",
      "into the hairline. The location of this incision is designed\n",
      "to hide any sign of the procedure later. The same proce-\n",
      "dure is repeated on the other side of the face. Using vari-\n",
      "ous instruments, the surgeon will then work to separate the\n",
      "skin of the face from its underlying tissue, moving down\n",
      "to the cheek and into the neck area and below the chin. Fat\n",
      "deposits over the cheeks and in the neck may be removed\n",
      "surgically or with liposuction at this time. The surgeon\n",
      "will then work to free up and tighten certain bands of mus-\n",
      "cle and tissue that extend up from the shoulder, below the\n",
      "chin, and up and behind the neck. If these muscles and tis-\n",
      "sue are not tightened, the looseness and sagging appear-\n",
      "ance of the skin will return. The surgeon then trims excess\n",
      "skin from the edges of the original incision, pulls the skin\n",
      "back, and staples or sutures it into place.\n",
      "Preparation\n",
      "Prior to the procedure, patients meet with their sur-\n",
      "geon to discuss the surgery, clarify the results that can be\n",
      "achieved, and discuss the potential problems that can\n",
      "occur. Having realistic expectations is important in any\n",
      "cosmetic procedure. Patients will learn, for example, that\n",
      "although face lift surgery can improve the contour of the\n",

      "Familial polyposis (FP) is known by many syn-\n",
      "onyms, most include some combination of words which\n",

      "festation of the disorder, the word, polyp, is usually in\n",
      "the term as well. Adenoma refers to the particular kind of\n",
      "polyp that is typically discovered. Some of the names\n",
      "found in medical texts and journals include polyposis\n",
      "coli, familial colonic polyposis, multiple familial polypo-\n",
      "sis, familial adenomatous colon polyposis, adenomatosis\n",
      "of the colon and rectum (ACR), and familial adenoma-\n",
      "tous polyposis (FAP). The last term and its abbreviation\n",
      "have been commonly used since the early 1990s. It will\n",
      "be used in this discussion.\n",
      "Familial polyposis or familial adenomatous poly-\n",
      "posis (FAP) is a premalignant disease. This means that\n",
      "a person with FAP, if left untreated, will invariably\n",
      "develop cancer . Individuals with this disorder grow\n",
      "hundreds of polyps throughout their large intestines.\n",
      "The polyps, which may also be called adenomas, com-\n",
      "monly develop just after puberty . Approximately half\n",
      "of all FAP patients will have polyps by age 14. Ninety\n",
      "percent will have detectable polyps by age 25. Usually\n",
      "by age 35–40, one or more of these polyps will become\n",
      "cancerous.\n",
      "FAP is a rare disease. One in 8,000 people in the\n",
      "United States have FAP. However, it may be very com-\n",
      "mon in affected families. FAP is inherited in an autoso-\n",
      "mal dominant pattern. This means that a person with FAP\n",
      "has a 50% chance of passing the condition down to each\n",
      "of their children. FAP can also develop in someone with\n",
      "no family history of the disorder, due to a new genetic\n",
      "mutation in that individual. It is thought that approxi-\n",
      "mately one percent of all colorectal cancers in the United\n",
      "States can be attributed to FAP.\n",
      "Causes and symptoms\n",
      "FAP is caused by a portion of a gene that mutates or\n",
      "changes. The original cause of the mutation is unknown.\n",
      "Its exact role in FAP is not completely clear. Researchers\n",
      "theorize that the normal gene directs the manufacture of\n",
      "a protein which helps control cell growth. The mutated\n",
      "gene section in FAP generates an abnormal protein\n",
      "which does not perform its normal function. Cells grow\n",
      "out of control, causing the development of multiple,\n",
      "sometimes hundreds, of polyps. One or more of these\n",
      "eventually becomes cancerous.\n",
      "Many individuals develop polyps without display-\n",
      "ing any symptoms. Others experience such gastrointesti-\n",
      "nal problems as diarrhea , constipation , abdominal\n",
      "cramps, blood in the stool, or weight loss. FAP patients\n",
      "may also develop nonmalignant tumors (desmoid\n",
      "tumors), and/or some bone and dental abnormalities. In\n",
      "addition, they may exhibit a “spot” on the retina of the\n",
      "eye (congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment\n",
      "epithelium, or CHRPE).\n",

      "of ancient times and many of the oldest healing systems\n",

      "ment for years. Many spas and treatment centers, particu-\n",

      "ically supervised fasting. Fasting has gained popularity\n",
      "in American alternative medicine over the past several\n",
      "decades, and many doctors feel it is beneficial. Fasting is\n",
      "a central therapy in detoxification, a healing method\n",
      "founded on the principle that the build up of toxic sub-\n",
      "stances in the body is responsible for many illnesses and\n",
      "conditions.\n",
      "The principle of fasting is simple. When the intake\n",
      "of food is temporarily stopped, many systems of the\n",
      "body are given a break from the hard work of digestion.\n",
      "The extra energy gives the body the chance to heal and\n",
      "restore itself, and burning stored calories gets rid of toxic\n",
      "substances stored in the body.\n",
      "The digestive tract is the part of the body most\n",
      "exposed to environmental threats, including bacteria,\n",
      "viruses, parasites, and toxins. It requires the most\n",
      "immune system support. When food is broken down in\n",
      "the intestines, it travels through the blood to the liver, the\n",
      "largest organ of the body’s natural detoxification system.\n",
      "The liver breaks down and removes the toxic by-products\n",
      "produced by digestion, including natural ones and the\n",
      "chemicals now present in the food supply. During fast-\n",
      "ing, the liver and immune system are essentially freed to\n",
      "detoxify and heal other parts of the body.\n",
      "Many healers claim that fasting is a particularly use-\n",
      "ful therapy for Americans and for the modern lifestyle,\n",
      "subjected to heavy diets, overeating, and constant expo-\n",
      "sure to food additives and chemicals. Some alternative\n",

      "age American is carrying 5-10 pounds of toxic sub-\n",
      "stances in their bodies, for which fasting is the quickest\n",
      "and most effective means of removal.\n",
      "Physiology of fasting\n",
      "Through evolution, the body became very efficient\n",
      "at storing energy and handling situations when no food\n",
      "was available. For many centuries, fasting was probably\n",
      "a normal occurrence for most people, and the body\n",
      "adapted to it. It is estimated that even very thin people\n",
      "can survive for 40 days or more without food. The body\n",
      "has a special mechanism that is initiated when no food is\n",
      "eaten. Fasting is not starvation , but rather the body’s\n",
      "burning of stored energy. Starvation occurs when the\n",
      "body no longer has any stored energy and begins using\n",
      "essential tissues such as organs for an energy source.\n",
      "Therapeutic fasts are stopped long before this happens.\n",
      "Many physiological changes occur in the body dur-\n",
      "ing fasting. During the first day or so, the body uses its\n",
      "glycogen reserves, the sugars that are the basic energy\n",
      "supply. After these are depleted, the body begins using\n",
      "fat. However, the brain, which has high fuel require-\n",
      "ments, still needs glucose (sugars converted from glyco-\n",
      "gen). To obtain glucose for the brain, the body begins to\n",
      "break down muscle tissue during the second day of the\n",
      "fast. Thus, during fasting some muscle loss will occur. To\n",
      "fuel the brain, the body would need to burn over a pound\n",
      "of muscle a day, but the body has developed another way\n",
      "to create energy that saves important muscle mass. This\n",
      "protein-sparing process is called ketosis, which occurs\n",
      "during the third day of a fast for men and the second day\n",
      "for women. In this highly efficient state, the liver begins\n",
      "converting stored fat and other nonessential tissues into\n",

      "mone levels and certain functions become more stable in\n",
      "this state as well. The goal of most fasts is to allow the\n",

      "and unneeded or damaged tissue. Thus, fasts longer than\n",
      "three days are generally recommended as therapy.\n",
      "Weight loss occurs most rapidly during the first few\n",

      "Fasts can be performed for varying lengths of time,\n",
      "depending on the person and his or her health require-\n",
      "ments. For chronic conditions, therapists recommend\n",
      "from two to four weeks to get the most benefits. Seven-\n",
      "day fasts are also commonly performed. A popular fast-\n",
      "ing program for prevention and general health is a three-\n",
      "day fast taken four times per year, at the change of each\n",
      "season. These can be easily performed over long week-\n",
      "ends. Preventative fasts of one day per week are used by\n",
      "many people as well.\n",
      "Juice fasts are also used by many people, although\n",
      "these are not technically fasts. Juice fasts are less inten-\n",
      "sive than water fasts because the body doesn’t reach the\n",
      "ketosis stage. The advantage of juice fasts is that fruit and\n",
      "vegetable drinks can supply extra energy and nutrients.\n",
      "People can fit a few days of juice fasting into their normal\n",
      "schedules without significant drops in energy. Juice fasts\n",
      "are also said to have cleansing and detoxifying effects.\n",
      "The disadvantage of juice fasts is that the body never gets\n",
      "to the ketosis stage, so these fasters are thought to lack the\n",
      "deep detoxification and healing effects of the water fast.\n",
      "Medical supervision is recommended for any fast\n",
      "over three days. Most alternative medicine practitioners,\n",
      "such as homeopaths, naturopathic doctors, and ayurvedic\n",
      "doctors, can supervise and monitor patients during fasts.\n",
      "Those performing extended fasts and those with health\n",
      "conditions may require blood, urine, and other tests dur-\n",
      "ing fasting. There are many alternative health clinics that\n",
      "perform medically supervised fasts as well. Some con-\n",
      "ventional medical doctors may also supervise patients\n",
      "during fasts. Costs and insurance coverage vary, depend-\n",
      "ing on the doctor, clinic, and requirements of the patient.\n",
      "Preparations\n",
      "Fasts must be entered and exited with care. To enter\n",
      "a fast, the diet should be gradually lightened over a few\n",
      "days. First, heavy foods such as meats and dairy products\n",
      "should be eliminated for a day or two. Grains, nuts, and\n",
      "beans should then be reduced for several days. The day\n",
      "before a fast, only easily digested foods like fruits, light\n",
      "salads, and soups should be eaten. During the fast, only\n",
      "pure water and occasional herbal teas should be drunk.\n",
      "Fasts should be ended as gradually as they are\n",
      "entered, going from lighter to heavier foods progressive-\n",
      "ly. The diet after a fast should emphasize fresh, whole-\n",
      "some foods. Fasters should particularly take care not to\n",
      "overeat when they complete a fast.\n",
      "Precautions\n",
      "Fasting isn’t appropriate for everyone and, in some\n",
      "cases, could be harmful. Any person undertaking a first\n",
      "fast longer than three days should seek medical supervi-\n",
      "sion. Those with health conditions should always have\n",
      "medical support during fasting. Plenty of water should be\n",
      "taken by fasters since dehydration can occur. Saunas and\n",
      "sweating therapies are sometimes recommended to assist\n",
      "detoxification, but should be used sparingly. Those fasting\n",
      "should significantly slow down their lifestyles. Taking\n",
      "time off of work is helpful, or at least reducing the work\n",
      "load. Fasters should also get plenty of rest. Exercise\n",
      "should be kept light, such as walking and gentle stretching.\n",
      "Side effects\n",

      "may be useful.\n",
      "The breast is not supposed to be a soft, smooth organ.\n",
      "It is actually a type of sweat gland. Milk, the breasts’ ver-\n",
      "sion of sweat, is secreted when the breast receives appro-\n",
      "priate hormonal and environmental stimulation.\n",
      "The normal breast contains milk glands, with their\n",
      "accompanying ducts, or pipelines, for transporting the\n",
      "milk. These complex structures may not only alter in size,\n",
      "but can increase or decrease in number as needed. Fibrous\n",
      "connective tissue, fatty tissue, nerves, blood and lymph\n",
      "vessels, and lymph nodes, with their different shapes and\n",
      "textures, lie among the ever-changing milk glands. It is no\n",
      "wonder that a woman’s breasts may not feel uniform in\n",
      "texture and that the “lumpiness” may wax and wane.\n",
      "The fibrocystic condition refers to the tenderness,\n",
      "enlargement, and/or changing “lumpiness” that many\n",
      "women encounter just before or during their menstrual\n",
      "periods. At this time, female hormones are preparing the\n",
      "breasts for pregnancy, by stimulating the milk-produc-\n",
      "ing cells, and storing fluid. Each breast may contain as\n",
      "much as three to six teaspoons of excess fluid. Swelling,\n",
      "with increased sensitivity or pain, may result. If preg-\n",
      "nancy does not occur, the body reabsorbs the fluid, and\n",
      "the engorgement and discomfort are relieved.\n",
      "Symptoms of fibrocystic breast condition range\n",
      "from mildly annoying in some women to extremely\n",
      "painful in others. The severity of discomfort may vary\n",
      "from month to month in the same woman. Although\n",
      "sometimes distressing, this experience is the body’s nor-\n",
      "mal response to routine hormonal changes.\n",
      "This cycle of breast sensitivity, pain and/or enlarge-\n",
      "ment, can also result from medications. Some hormone\n",
      "replacement therapies (estrogen and progesterone) used\n",
      "for postmenopausal women can produce these effects.\n",
      "Other medications, primarily, but not exclusively those\n",
      "with hormones may also provoke these symptoms.\n",
      "Breast pain unrelated to hormone shifts is called\n",
      "“noncyclic” pain. “Trigger-zone breast pain” is a term\n",
      "that may also be used to describe this area-specific pain.\n",
      "This type of pain may be continuous, or it may be felt\n",
      "intermittently. Trauma, such as a blow to the chest area, a\n",
      "prior breast biopsy, or sensitivity to certain medications\n",
      "may also underlie this type of pain. Fibrocystic condition\n",

      "Causes and symptoms\n",
      "Fifth disease is caused by the human parvovirus B19,\n",
      "a member of the Parvoviridae family of viruses, that lives\n",
      "in the nose and throat of the infected person. The virus is\n",
      "spread through the air by coughing and sneezing. Because\n",
      "the virus needs a rapidly dividing cell in order to multiply,\n",
      "it attacks the red blood cells of the body. Once infected, a\n",
      "person is believed to be immune to reinfection.\n",
      "Symptoms may appear four to 21 days after being\n",
      "exposed to the virus. Initial symptoms are flu-like and\n",
      "include headache, body ache, sore throat, a mild fever\n",
      "of 101°F (38.3°C), and chills. It is at this time, prior to\n",

      "raised and may or may not be itchy. Sometimes, the rash\n",
      "spreads to the arms, legs, and trunk, where it has a lace-\n",
      "like or net-like appearance. The rash can also involve the\n",
      "palms of the hands and soles of the feet. By the time the\n",

      "average, the rash lasts for 10–11 days, but may last for as\n",

      "Adults generally do not develop a rash, but instead may\n",

      "Ciguatera\n",
      "Definition\n",
      "Ciguatera (from the Spanish word for a poisonous\n",
      "snail) is a food-related illness that causes abdominal and\n",
      "neurological symptoms.\n",
      "Causes and symptoms\n",
      "Ciguatera is caused by eating fish that have a toxin\n",
      "called ciguatoxin. Scientists believe this toxin is acquired\n",
      "by the fish through the food chain, and is originally pro-\n",
      "duced by small algae microorganisms (dinoflagellates).\n",
      "The fish most likely contaminated with ciguatoxin are\n",
      "those that feed close to tropical reefs, including red snap-\n",
      "per, grouper, and barracuda. Larger fish are more likely\n",
      "to contain the toxin. Although not as common in the\n",
      "United States, ciguatera is commonly diagnosed on\n",
      "many of the islands in the Pacific Ocean.\n",
      "Illness from ciguatera can occur in just a few min-\n",
      "utes to about 30 hours after eating. Most cases occur one\n",
      "to six hours after eating the contaminated fish. Initial\n",
      "symptoms are abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, or\n",
      "watery diarrhea . The most characteristic symptoms of\n",
      "the illness are those involving the nervous system. These\n",
      "include numbness and tingling around the lips, tongue,\n",
      "and mouth; itching ; dry mouth ; metallic taste in the\n",
      "mouth; and blurry vision. In more prominent cases,\n",
      "patients may complain of temporary blindness, a slow\n",
      "pulse, and a feeling that their teeth are loose. Patients\n",
      "may also have the strange symptom of reversal of hot and\n",
      "cold sensations on the skin, where cold things feel very\n",
      "hot or painful to the touch. In very severe cases, there\n",
      "may be difficulties in breathing or low blood pressure.\n",
      "Diagnosis\n",
      "Ciguatera diagnosis is based on the typical combina-\n",
      "tion of symptoms after eating fish. There are no readily\n",
      "available blood or urine tests to detect the poisoning, but\n",
      "some researchers have developed a test for the toxin left\n",
      "on any remaining fish. A person does not have to be in a\n",
      "tropical area to get ciguatera. Fish can be caught from\n",
      "one of these distant areas, and can then be shipped and\n",
      "eaten locally. It is important to report suspected cases to\n",
      "local public health officials because more cases may\n",
      "occur from other contaminated fish.\n",
      "Treatment\n",
      "The treatment for this illness is general. Patients are\n",
      "given fluids (by mouth or through a vein) and medica-\n",
      "tions to decrease the itching or to treat vomiting and/or\n",
      "diarrhea. The neurological symptoms can cause discom-\n",
      "fort and treatment with amitriptyline (a medicine that has\n",
      "been used for depression) may be useful. Other medica-\n",
      "tions may also be given.\n",
      "Prognosis\n",
      "Although death can occur, almost all patients diag-\n",
      "nosed with ciguatera will recover. Recovery, however,\n",
      "can be slow and some symptoms can last for weeks or\n",

      "Purpose\n",
      "Flower remedies are more homeopathic than herbal\n",
      "in the way they work, effecting energy levels rather than\n",
      "chemical balances. They have been described as “liquid\n",
      "energy.” The theory is that they encapsulate the flowers’\n",
      "healing energy, and are said to deal with and overcome\n",
      "negative emotions, and so relieve blockages in the flow\n",
      "of human energy that can cause illness.\n",
      "Description\n",
      "Origins\n",
      "Perhaps the most famous and widely used system is\n",
      "the Bach flower remedies. This system originated in the\n",
      "1920s when British physician and bacteriologist, Dr.\n",
      "Edward Bach (1886–1936), noticed that patients with\n",
      "physical complaints often seemed to be suffering from\n",
      "anxietyor some kind of negative emotion. He concluded\n",
      "that assessing a patient’s emotional disposition and pre-\n",
      "scribing an appropriate flower essence could treat the\n",
      "physical illness. Bach was a qualified medical doctor, but\n",
      "he also practiced homeopathy.\n",
      "As a result of his own serious illness in 1917, Bach\n",
      "began a search for a new and simple system of medicine\n",
      "that would treat the whole person. In 1930, he gave up his\n",
      "flourishing practice on Harley Street at the Royal London\n",
      "Homeopathic Hospital and moved to the countryside to\n",
      "devote his life to this research. It is known that at this\n",
      "point, he ceased to dispense the mixture of homeopathy\n",
      "and allopathic medicine that he had been using. Instead, he\n",
      "began investigating the healing properties of plant\n",
      "essences and discovered that he possessed an “intuition”\n",
      "for judging the properties of each flower. Accordingly, he\n",
      "developed the system of treatment that bears his name, and\n",
      "is also the foundation for all other flower-remedy systems.\n",
      "The Bach Flower Remedies were ostensibly the only\n",
      "system of significance from the 1920s until in the 1970s,\n",
      "when there was a renewed interest in the subject by doc-\n",
      "tors working in the field of natural medicine. Perhaps the\n",
      "most notable was Dr. Richard Katz, who was seeking new\n",
      "methods of dealing with modern stress and the resulting\n",
      "ailments. He focused on the concept of a psychic, psycho-\n",
      "logical effect and chose to pursue this line of research.\n",
      "In 1979, Katz founded the Flower Essence Society\n",
      "in California, (FES). This society pledged to further the\n",
      "research and development of Bach’s principles. As of\n",
      "2000, FES hosts a database of over 100 flower essences\n",
      "from more than 50 countries. FES is now an international\n",
      "organization of health practitioners, researchers, stu-\n",
      "dents, and others concerned with flower essence therapy.\n",
      "The Society has connections with an estimated\n",
      "50,000 active practitioners from around the world, who\n",
      "use flower essence therapy as part of their treatment. FES\n",
      "encourages the study of the plants themselves to deter-\n",
      "mine the characteristics of flower essences. They are\n",
      "compiling an extensive database of case studies and prac-\n",
      "titioner reports of the use of essences therapeutically,\n",
      "allowing verification and development of the original\n",
      "definitions. They are also engaged in the scientific study\n",
      "of flower essence therapy.\n",
      "FES says they have developed the theories of Paracel-\n",
      "sus and Goethe who researched the “signatures” and “ges-\n",
      "tures” of botanical specimens, on the premise that the\n",
      "human body and soul are a reflection of the system of\n",
      "nature. FES plant research interprets the therapeutic prop-\n",
      "erties of flower essences according to these insights.\n",
      "In this regard, they have devised 12 “windows of\n",
      "perception” for monitoring the attributes of plants. Each\n",
      "of these windows reveals an aspect of the plant’s quali-\n",

      "is essential to obtaining an overview of its properties as a\n",

      "seasonal cycles. Why do some flowers bloom at different\n",
      "times of the day, while others, such as the evening prim-\n",
      "rose, respond to the moon? The fifth window observes a\n",
      "plant’s relationship to its environment. Where a plant\n",
      "chooses to grow, and where it cannot survive, reveals\n",
      "much about its qualities. The sixth window observes a\n",
      "plant’s relationship to the Four Elements and the Four\n",
      "Ethers, as FES maintains that plants exist in one of the\n",
      "elemental or etheric forces in addition to their physical\n",
      "life. “Elements” refers to those developed by the Greeks,\n",
      "as opposed to the modern concept of “molecular building\n",
      "blocks.” It seems that commonly, two elements predomi-\n",
      "nate in a plant, indicating a polarity of qualities, while\n",
      "two can be said to be recessive. The seventh window\n",
      "relates to a plant’s relationship with the other kingdoms of\n",
      "nature: mineral, animal and human, while the eighth\n",
      "relates to the color and color variations of a plant. Katz\n",
      "explains how the language of color tells us so much about\n",
      "the “soul qualities” of a plant. The ninth window concerns\n",
      "all other sensory perceptions of a plant, such as fragrance,\n",
      "texture, and taste. The tenth window involves assessing\n",
      "the chemical substances and properties; the eleventh stud-\n",
      "ies medicinal and herbal uses, as by studying the physical\n",
      "healing properties of plants, we can also understand\n",
      "something of their more subtle effects on the soul. Finally,\n",
      "the twelfth window involves the study of the lore, mythol-\n",
      "ogy, folk wisdom, and spiritual and ritual qualities associ-\n",
      "ated with a particular plant. Katz relates how in the past,\n",
      "human beings were more in touch with the natural world,\n",
      "and the remnants of this unconscious plant wisdom live\n",
      "on in the form of folklore, mythology, and so on.\n",
      "Because flower remedies operate on approximately\n",
      "the same principles as homeopathy, practitioners quite\n",

      "Frostbite is the term for damage to the skin and other\n",
      "tissues caused by freezing. Frostnip is a mild form of\n",
      "cold injury.\n",
      "Description\n",
      "In North America, frostbite is largely confined to\n",
      "Alaska, Canada, and the northern states. Recent years\n",
      "have witnessed a substantial decline in the number of\n",
      "cases, probably for several reasons, including better win-\n",

      "time, the nature of the at-risk population has changed as\n",
      "rising numbers of homeless people have made frostbite\n",
      "an urban as well as a rural public health concern. The\n",
      "growing popularity of outdoor winter activities has also\n",
      "expanded the at-risk population.\n",
      "Causes and symptoms\n",
      "Frostbite\n",
      "Skin exposed to temperatures a little below the\n",
      "freezing mark can take hours to freeze, but very cold skin\n",
      "can freeze in minutes or seconds. Air temperature, wind\n",
      "speed, and moisture all affect how cold the skin becomes.\n",
      "A strong wind can lower skin temperature considerably\n",
      "by dispersing the thin protective layer of warm air that\n",
      "surrounds our bodies. Wet clothing readily draws heat\n",
      "away from the skin because water is a potent conductor\n",
      "of heat. The evaporation of moisture on the skin also pro-\n",
      "duces cooling. For these reasons, wet skin or clothing on\n",
      "a windy day can lead to frostbite even if the air tempera-\n",

      "The extent of permanent injury, however, is deter-\n",

      "the ice produces pressure changes that cause water (crucial\n",

      "and venules (the smallest arteries and veins). Damage also\n",
      "occurs to the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels.\n",

      "injury). Most frostbite injuries affect the feet or hands. The\n",
      "remaining 10% of cases typically involve the ears, nose,\n",
      "cheeks, or penis. Once frostbite sets in, the affected part\n",
      "begins to feel cold and, usually, numb; this is followed by\n",
      "a feeling of clumsiness. The skin turns white or yellowish.\n",
      "Many patients experience severe pain in the affected part\n",
      "during rewarming treatment and an intense throbbing pain\n",
      "that arises two or three days later and can last days or\n",
      "weeks. As the skin begins to thaw during treatment,\n",
      "edema(excess tissue fluid) often accumulates, causing\n",

      "appear. Third-degree cases produce deep, blood-filled blis-\n",
      "ters and, during the second week, a hard black eschar\n",

      "the muscles, tendons, nerves, and bones. In severe cases of\n",

      "Like frostbite, frostnip is associated with ice crystal\n",
      "formation in the tissues, but no tissue destruction occurs and\n",
      "the crystals dissolve as soon as the skin is warmed. Frostnip\n",
      "affects areas such as the earlobes, cheeks, nose, fingers, and\n",

      "tingling in the affected part until warming begins.\n",
      "Diagnosis\n",
      "Frostbite diagnosis relies on a physical examina-\n",
